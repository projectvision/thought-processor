There are 3 directories

1. data: contains all the data (emails, train data, test data)
2. scripts: contains scripts to preprocess data, script for making the webApi
3. libshorttext-1.0: library for building the SVM model (a machine learning algorihtm for classification)


Before executing, you might have to re-build the library. (I build it for linux 32 bit)
Move to libshorttext-1.0/ directory and execute:
make clean
make


How to execute

1. create the training an test data
Move to scripts directory and execute:
"python classifpy"


2. train the model
Move to libshorttext-1.0/ directory and execute:
"python text-train.py ../data/training_data"
1st argument is the path of training data

3. test the model
Move to libshorttext-1.0/ directory and execute:
"python text-predict.py ../data/testing_data training_data.model/ results"
1st argument is path of test data, 2nd argument is path to the model, 3rd argument is path to a file for storing results


For more training and testing options, check the README in libshorttext-1.0/

For real time prediction
Move to scripts and execute:
"python predict.py <PATH_TO_MODEL>"
Example: "python predict.py ../libshorttext-1.0/training_data.model/"
