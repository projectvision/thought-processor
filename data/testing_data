5.0	here are my notes from today's call  as with monday  i've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject  enron's business has been grouped into three buckets  core  non-core  and under review  core  wholesale energy business in north america and europe  retail energy  pipelines non-core  broadband  water  and international assets  i e  egas   enron has approx  $ bn in investments in these assets  and they have produced 'dismal' returns  enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion  an aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets  under review  egm  eim  these businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability  required resource levels are being carefully studied  following review  enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates  approximately $   mm of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter  these include a gas ldc in brazil  ecoelectrica  and our indian e p assets  enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $   mm- bn  given the current environment  raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient'  mcmahon says  short-term liquidity is provided by the $ bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago  the $ bn of new debt  and the $   bn equity infusion from dynegy  longer-term  the proceeds from the sale of pge will provide liquidity  asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt  mcmahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles  marlin was set up to hold azurix assets  it was initially capitalized with $   mm of    a debt and $   mm of equity  raised from enron and institutional investors   the debt is supported by the equity and by azurix' assets  enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on          the 'enron topup' obligation   the         date is accelerated in the event that enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies  the primary asset of marlin is wessex water  as long as wessex is worth at least $   bn  there will be no enron topup required  if we take a     haircut to present book value  enron will have to provide $   mm in consideration upon retirement of the debt  this $   mm would hit enron cash  income  and equity balances  osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'  it was initially capitalized with $   bn of    a debt and $   mm in equity  ene and institutionals   as with marlin  the entity is an asset-backed structure with an enron topup guarantee  the debt is supported by a  the assets  b  $ bn of convertible preferred ene  convertible into   mm shares of ene common   and c  additional ene common as needed for topup  assuming the same     hypothetical haircut to current book value  enron would have to deliver approx  $   mm of topup funds--which would hit ene cash  income  and equity  the debt must be retired by          with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as marlin  yosemite and the credit-linked notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'  the underlying transactions are already on enron's balance sheet  mcmahon says that there is no enron share obligation related to these instruments  dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles  mcmahon says  our   q will be filed five days late  the   q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles  the special committee investigation is still ongoing  the committee meets  -  times week  sometimes more often  the outside auditors  d t  and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually   days a week'  lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation  mcmahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for  that analysis is underway  but it will not be complete for some time  osprey contains the european power projects  trakya and saarlux   some north american merchant investments  and some brazilian assets  under the merger agreement  enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than     of the balance sheet without dynegy approval  however  an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without dynegy approval  broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'   did not catch this part clearly   the ene topup obligation for marlin  represented by ene common that would have to be delivered  will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of dyn shares upon closing  $   bn of debt is carried at the azurix level  current book value of the osprey assets is $   bn  no dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general mac clause and the $   bn legal liability clause  yosemite and the credit-linked notes are functionally equivalent to ene senior unsecured debt  this section somewhat unclear   the underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'  the transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities  the swaps related to yosemite and the clns would be financially settled  whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes  he said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products  acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week  says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels  it will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us  mcmahon  there hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers  but 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions  some of the flows ' whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week  lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses  the situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure  he says  the cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses  whalley then quickly interjects  some might say interrrupts  with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our north american energy trading business  we will be looking at  perhaps  streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments  but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business  mcmahon  "the company is overlevered  that's a fact "--hence our pursuit of additional equity  mcmahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week  ene had approx  $ bn in cash as of       which mcmahon points out would be unusual for us  as before  give me a call at  -

21.0	dear dr  lay  we met less than a week ago  on wednesday    may       during the oecd forum      in paris  i'm an independent consultant and innovator  with a special interest in energy and new technologies  i have more than ten years experience in research and innovation in economics  business and technology  i attended the session on energy you chaired during that oecd forum  after the session  i had a discussion with you  unfortunately  your time was too short  you gave me your card and asked me to write you  as i told you  i think i can add value to your staff  bring new lines of businesses to enron and with them  many new clients  and above all  unprecedented profits  i am writing you to propose my contribution in these purposes  i'm mainly making three proposals to enron    - working for enron as an external consultant  here  i would rather like to work on assignments  medium or long term  with a preference for the following jobs  risk assessment and or management  strategic analysis on geopolitical  macroeconomics and societal issues  i think these are important tasks for a company like enron  the current problems with enron's dabhol power plant in the maharashtra state in india stresses the kind of importance i'm mentioning  i can also conduct surveys and provide enron with technical and fruitful information and policy recommendations  i've done a job like that recently  on the oil-pipeline project in chad and cameroon  as you may already know  this is a $  billion project recently launched  with the support of the world bank  and led by three major energy firms  exxon and chevron of the usa  and petronas of malaysia  i wrote a detailed and long report  which combined public and private sectors' concerns  and also communities' interests  having operations worldwide  enron i think needs the type of technical works i've done on that major energy project  i have a good expertise in energy economics  i attend international congresses on that subject  for instance in boston in january       since more than five years  as a journalist or as an independent consultant  i have been covering the works and studies of  or participated to workshops and seminar organized by  the iea  international energy association   i know mr  robert priddle  iea chair  who also attended that energy session during the oecd forum       i know the work he and his team of experts have been doing    - being fully employed by enron  in this respect  i would prefer to work as a researcher for either enron project development and management or capital and risk management departments  in these fields  i've also innovated  i've created among concepts  tools and processes  for instance  the "sensible guide for action"  this is a tool theoretically powerful and practically very efficacious  it's main goal is to help decision-makers  in both private and public sectors  the sensible guide for action assists them in their approach to solve technical problems  the sga is a five-leaf bough  i've also created a method to assess a firm capacity to create wealth  this method can be adapted to fit some particular projects  the method is very useful in countries where there's no stocks market  and where capital markets are not sufficiently large  that's the case of underdeveloped countries in general  where yet the energy demand if forecast to grow the most in the coming decades  enron cannot overlook this  or miss the business and profit opportunities in this growth    - the business of businesses  dear dr lay  if you accept this third proposal  it will probably be the best investment enron has ever made  i'm an independent researcher and entrepreneur  with a strong quantitative analysis competence  and a multidisciplinary background  both by education and professionally  i'm a graduate in mathematics and in mechanical engineering  university of paris  and also in business and economics  institut d'etudes politiques of paris   in this third proposal i'm bringing to enron two key inventions i've made  two types of financial products targeting consumers and companies  i believe they will interest enron  these products have a market potential worldwide  unlimited  they will create an entirely new industry  the business of businesses  i'm currently looking for investors with whom i can launch those products  we will be the world leader here  and remain in that position for a long time before copycats try to reach us  i've created the products  and nobody knows about them or about their extraordinary markets  i started to talk to you about these products when we met  but you were hurrying  and the many solicitations and noises of the forum made it difficult to explain my point  i'm writing you as you asked me  because firstly i believe these products will interest enron  secondly i know how these products will boost three types of enron services  online marketplace  broadband services  and energy   commodities  plus  these products  and the business of businesses they create are an excellent placement for enron  among the many reasons why i believe my products will interest enron are these   i  their market is global   ii  they are directly related to consumption and savings   iii  they're excellent saving vehicles  for instance for pension or life insurance   iv  they concern payment transactions and transmissions  and thanks to information technology  costs here decrease while productivity will grow    v  they are both offline and online business  these products will be excellent for enron e-business    vi  i want to be and remain a global leader   vii  the products' growth potential is borderless  viii  there's no competitor and before copycats arrive we would have strongly imposed ourselves as the leader and the reference  increasing chances that customers remain faithful to us   ix  my products will allow enron to beat its competitors   x  enron will earn a lot of revenues  many new clients  and very big and unprecedented profits  i'm looking for investors willing to put around $  million  given that the revenues generated can very rapidly reach the range of $    million to $  billion  that initial $  million is a wise and very profitable investment  if you're interested  i'm ready to present the products and its business scenario to you  the business model is very innovative  unprecedented  these products' market is the whole world  but the first three markets i would like to attack are the uk  germany and moreover  japan  today's news about japan is rather bad  economists and many observers see a declining japan  me not  they may be right from a pure statistical and macroeconomic viewpoint  but they fail to see deeper  they overlook the other face of japan  for my part  i see great business opportunities in japan  today and for the coming decade  particularly for the financial products i'm proposing  these financial products i want enron to launch with me in japan  perfectly fit japanese consumption manners  their problematic pension system  and life insurance structure there  public pension systems are under pressure every where  particularly in japan  in germany they are trying to reform it  but there's no consensus in the governments  federal and states'  or in the parliaments  federal and states'   last week  chancellor gerhard schr der won some parliamentary approval  but the package he proposed is far from solving the issue  in the meantime  problems may accumulate  the situation could worsen  what seems sure is that in a foreseeable future  governments  not only in germany but in all developed and ageing countries  will no longer be able to pay pensions at the level they have promised or are continuing to promise  an additional bad news  even company pensions will suffer  in today's "financial times"  tuesday    may       page      peter thompson  incoming chairman of the british national association of pension funds "warned uk workers that they would no longer rely on comfortable company"  he adds that "many wold have to work until they were    --    years longer than the current retirement age - if they wanted to enjoy a financially comfortable old age"  therefore  workers and citizens should start  right no  to save for themselves  my products are here the best saving vehicle i know  and to what i know of enron  it seems to me that enron's shareholders also will appreciate the kind of new business and investment opportunity i'm bringing to their company  they will allow enron to create a new and unprecedented business model that all its competitors will envy  in a way  enron will change for its advantage  the way to do business in general  and energy business in particular  thanks to the "business of businesses" concept i've elaborated  dear dr  lay  as i read in enron's web site  the list of awards you have received  impressive  congratulations  two qualities common to all of them are leadership and creativity  i wish these will help you to catch the wonderful opportunity i'm bringing to you  in order to allow enron to accomplish a phenomenal progress  leadership and moreover creativity are also two qualities i've been trying to put into practice  this effort creates a sort of affinity between us  thus  i think we can easily understand one another  speaking in some way  the same language  hence an additional reason that brings me to write you and to make my proposal directly to you  given what i've learned of enron's vision and values  i would like to stress four of the twelve headings that are listed in enron "vision and values" page  innovation  diversity  change and excellence  four headings that are at work in each of the three proposals i've just made to you  when i knew you were coming to that forum  i prepared some materials for you and was ready to present my proposals to you in details and to answer all your questions  i'm still ready to do it  i'm even ready to come to houston for that purpose  in one recent enron's ad  i read   "enron  endless possibilities"  let's make it true  let's do it together  let's reap the enormous benefits of "the business of businesses"  thank you

6.0	dear ken  it was great to see you in denver  the group of leaders from the western governors' association and major businesses were energized to take control of their destiny  and your ideas contributed enormously  i think that you and i are very much on the same page regarding the president's energy report and the opportunities that it presents  in addition  joe romm and i have worked a bit with the enron energy services team on some initial ways to highlight and quantify the "green" aspects of the ees product  you are well positioned to prove what initiatives bring both business and energy environmental benefits  per our discussion  i have attached below a copy of a confidential preliminary report on the potential for a "cooler houston" initiative  the scientific models relating to "urban heat island effects" indicate that planting trees  lightening the color of roofs and resurfacing pavement with lighter material can reduce ambient high temperatures in houston and thus potentially lead to ozone reductions far cheaper than the cost of the "last mile" tons indicated in current sip efforts  success requires developing some technical agreement and common cause among u s  epa  tnrcc  the city of houston  and business and civic leaders in the city  bill white and the leadership of the greater houston partnership have been spearheading early work on this  our team is working with u s  epa and tnrcc to see if they can agree on the models  we would be very interested in your ideas on this  moreover  if the technical people can agree in concept  we would value your support of an achievable cooler houston plan going forward  naturally  the plan is exciting because it offers economic  air quality and broader quality-of-life benefits to the houston community  ever since we developed the acid rain trading program  i have enjoyed promoting such ideas  please let me know anything else that you need  i hope to see you soon  in the meantime  best wishes to you and the family  sincerely  hank habicht

5.0	we know how interested all of you are in the retention   severance plan  so we want to update you on its status  as many of you know  we have been working with members of the creditors' committee and their consultants since december to formulate a retention   severance plan  and we formally presented the plan to the committee on friday  february     we had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month  we know that many of you have career options outside of enron and that the retention   severance plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave  we sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed  we're learning that  in bankruptcy  most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed  the committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan  but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns  the creditors' committee fully supports the implementation of a retention   severance plan  such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy  these plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate  the creditors' committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process  to that end  we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee  we intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible  this is currently our top priority  bar none  when we filed for bankruptcy  we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be  unfortunately  that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place  we now know that it takes significant time  resources and effort to understand  identify and gather the massive volume of required details  to formulate that information into a reasonable program  and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation  the process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which enron has been involved  that serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse  we remain committed to working with the creditors' committee until we can reach agreement on a plan  we anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so  and have targeted the week of march    to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court  we will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court  with respect to non-debtor companies  or those companies not in bankruptcy  new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future  in the meantime  we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week  and of course  we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible

3.0	andy  just finished meeting with nelson from gas fundies and martin lim from power fundies to discuss getting the exotica libraries migrated asap  the best i can get from them is "hopefully tomorrow" as far as a date for migration  they are dealing with the validation of calculation routines between the ubs libraries and the exotica libraries since exotica will play a role in pnl calculation  i will follow up on this again tomorrow  i told them that "hopefully tomorrow" was not the answer i was looking for so i would help out in any way  they recognize that we need these libraries loaded on our machines regardless of their validation  also  nelson showed me a list of the products that are scheduled for 'day  ' and power options are not on that list  there are a lot of people working with that list to prioritize support so this is just a heads up for you  later  rob

1.0	as you know  enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron  we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing  even though enron has entered into this agreement  u s  and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other  in particular  to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets  their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed  therefore  for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement  in addition  all information  documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller  lance schuler  robert eickenroht  mark haedicke  rob walls or greg whalley of enron  it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained  to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement  then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals  if you have any questions concerning this notice  please contact lance schuler         -       robert eickenroht         -       mark haedicke         -      or rob walls         -       thank you for your help in this matter 
2.0	i would ask mike about the last sentence in bullet    based on the language of the quote the commission appears to be referring to the surcharge "adopted in d    -  -    " was the     surcharge "adopted" in that proceeding  maybe i am reading this too literally  i do agree that the rationale for exempting da customers from the   cent surcharge applies equally to the   cent surcharge  and that we should continue to strive for this clarification at the cpuc  which sue mara is handling   sue  i am forwarding this to you for your comments

19.0	gentlemen - following the dabhol dictate that "bad news is good news " dabhol is getting some good news this week  as reported in the press  dpc did receive a two-page letter from mseb purporting to rescind the ppa with immediate effect because dpc materially misrepresented the capabilities of the power plant  i e     hour actual ramp-up time vs    hour ramp-up schedule in the ppa   however  the letter goes on to state that mseb is "agreeable to continue the present arrangement of power and payment until disputes are resolved by the appropriate forum " we are not entirely sure what this last part means and are asking mseb for clarification  obviously  this letter is quite a buttress to our already-delivered ptn contending that mseb has evidenced an intention not to be bound by the ppa  while mseb's letter seems to state that they will still honor some aspects of the ppa  the letter adds that "payments would be subject to adjustments on the basis of determination of reasonable compensation and quantum meruit by a competent authority " we hear rumors that mseb will approach the maharasthra energy regulatory commission  merc  for a "how much should we pay dpc" determination  if they do so and merc accepts jurisdiction  this would help our expropriation  political force majeure and default arguments  dpc seems to have managed to avoid a construction contractor termination in may by agreeing to extend the required completion date for block b by   days  while this action does not have long-term benefits to the project  i believe that it was a considerable sign of good faith that dpc is trying to give the lenders some time to assess whether they want to begin curing project agreement defaults on an ongoing basis  bruce

11.0	over the past few weeks  we have experienced significant issues with our em  ail environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for  outlook users  the purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w  e have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues         during the last week of august  we encountered a bug in microsoft's exc  hange server -- the mail server that is used by outlook clients  this bug   which impacted approximately       users  delayed mail delivery for the be  tter part of a day  at that time  we applied a fix from microsoft which ap  pears to have resolved the problem  we have carefully monitored the exchan  ge servers for four weeks  and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug      also during the last week of august  another exchange server experience  d database corruption issues -- again  this impacted approximately       ou  tlook users  to resolve this  we moved the       users to different exchan  ge servers and made several hardware software upgrades to the affected serv  er  we have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --  we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit  h the server  while this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus  iness week  we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on w  ednesday  thursday  and friday  and throughout the labor day weekend to mov  e users to different servers  during these evenings and weekend  the impac  ted users could not access their e-mail      during the last three weeks  there have been a number of new and danger  ous viruses on the internet  we have a multi-layered defense against virus  es that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops  all mail   is scanned on the exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop  s  during the last few weeks  we have had to apply numerous virus scanning  updates to the exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day    the result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive  the performance  of the exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus   product rescans every message in every mailbox  this is unfortunate  but w  e believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the enron co  mputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems  at this t  ime  we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that   will speed up the virus scanning process  we have made some progress as th  e performance has improved during virus scans  however  it can continue to   get better  there is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las  t few weeks are unacceptable  we are continuing to monitor and improve the  overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and  meet enron's business needs and expectations  enron global technology
5.0	susan  your progress notes were in the tracking sheet  i just didn't notice them last night  sorry about that  if you plan on revising the curves in the 'revised price' column of the templates  don't bother updating the summary sheet until you've done that  remember  if you do revise a portion of the curve  that revised piece needs to be copied and pasted into the next day's template in column d  essentially  the summary sheet should be filled in when a date's curve has either been validated or revised and is awaiting review by ed  if you can complete all your basis curves by the end of the week so ed can review and sign-off  that would be great  i hope this clears things up  let me know if you have any questions

6.0	after giving this trade situation way too much thought  i have arrived at the following conclusions  giving examples along the way so blockheads like defoggi can understand the concepts       one suggestion is to have the online trading system allow first come  first serve between specified hours days as allotted by the website  unfortunately  the reality is that this won't work because there are available free agents on my team and the only way to add drop is that i become notified anyway and go in and manually do the transaction and waive the fee      power ratings so that the low man on the totem pole gets a chance for first pick  okay  so a trader makes a bad trade  loses money  gets fired  and then gets the same job trading elsewhere for more money  a loser is a loser and should be acknowledged as such  see feeley   those are the breaks in this game  besides  too time consuming for me to go through the numbers      free market    first come  first served  anytime  anywhere  this is a good concept in that those that dedicate the time to watching  studying  and anticipating an opportunity are allowed to seize the moment and get paid  and they should because it is just like a small business  you get out of it what you put into it  time is money  however  you can't do add drops once your lineup is set and you should only be able to apply trades to the upcoming week anyways      calling two fellow team owners to validate your trade  really  would you trust gibby in this situation  i can hear it now  "oh yeah  dude  i was drinking a soder pop when he called but he neva said anything about picking up that qb " so  i have reached what i call a fair and amicable solution to all of your f cked up problems  first  the core of someone's team is going to decide the results week in and week out  i've been in this long enough to know that pickups  especially in a big league  are rarely gonna make that big of a difference in the outcome of a season  past examples include wr thrash who had a spectacular game against seattle only to turn around and have a dismal game against the lowly cowboys  there was $   given to the pot  what i am getting at is that i think trading is way overrated and only serves to build the pot for the team that drafted the strongest in the beginning anyways  second  online access allows a level playing field  i agree with this and it should be implemented because it is also time stamped so there is no question as to who was first in a selection  if an owner is going to stoop so low as to change the clock on their computer to try and get an earlier time stamp  then there are bigger mental problems down the road and the money you make off the win should be applied accordingly  third  my time is just as important and so is a "transaction" period  for example  this weekend is octoberfest weekend in fredericksburg  if you think i am going to hang around and stay sober so i can meet your demands and implement your requests  you are sorely mistaken  i fully expect to start drinking myself into oblivion friday evening and don't expect to come out of my coma until sometime sunday evening so your changes requests questions need to be done by friday afternoon  so  here is what i suggest      to make an add drop  trade  transaction  click on the "owners" tab on the league homepage  found up top next to live chat   page down to the bottom of the page and send a broadcast email to all team members announcing your intentions  i will implement the trade s  on the tuesday following the monday night game  the transaction deadline is friday      pm for the weekend games  if i receive the email timestamped before then  i will make the trade for the upcoming weekend  if there is a thursday night game  thursday      pm is the deadline for the weekend  at any time after the deadline if a transaction is submitted  it will apply to the following weekend  also  there will be no limit on the amount of transactions  feel free to contribute as much as you wish      regarding current requested trades for the past weekend  for this week only  send me an email with your request  i will take one trade per team this week only  if two teams want the same free agent  whoever guesses closes to where the nasdaq composite closes wednesday  october  rd wins  the loser will be notified as such  so  be sure to include your guess  this should provide everyone easy online access to making trades  all you have to do is make sure the free agent is indeed free  that nobody has already sent you an email picking him up  and shoot a broadcast out to the owners proclaiming him as yours  simple  so  any questions or concerns can be sent back to discuss  i will shoot down all of them  i am going to lunch  i eagerly await the opportunity to tell you why your plan won't work

14.0	dear shareholders  several months have passed since i last told you of the pending sale of intelligent diagnostics inc  formerly known as askred com or drredduke inc  to dynasty technologies  unfortunately  the deal originally contemplated appears unlikely due to adverse market conditions and financing difficulties  which seem to be seriously impacting dynasty's business just like many other businesses  dynasty has been shrinking its operations and moving some of their operation overseas  we are currently exploring a new business plan with dynasty that would involve a newly created company spun off from dynasty as the principal vehicle for development of the diagnostic software and related products  such an approach may be the best way to proceed  however  a newly created entity will face all of the usual problems as any other startup  plus it will be doing so in a harsh economic environment  if you have any suggestions  please advise  i regret that we still have this business in a state of limbo and wish i could offer some encouraging news based on signs in the marketplace  i'm sure you are seeing the same bleak outlook that the wedge team  dr  casscells and i are encountering as we continue to chase leads for new sources of funds  i will send more updates as the possibilities evolve  please feel free to call me at any time                  office                home

14.0	dear mr  lay  recently i received notice that enron will no longer provide electric service for my residence "as a result of continued uncertainty in this market  as well as a lack of clarity on the future of direct access " i find this very disappointing and would like enron to re-consider this decision  i am a strong believer in the free market system and  in part  it was for this reason that i chose enron as my electric service provider several years ago when the market in california was deregulated  i also chose enron because of my knowledge of your company  its leadership and the strategic direction you have provided  never was there a time in the marketing of electric service to the state of california for a company such as enron to exhibit long range thinking   leadership  this is an opportunity for enron to show commitment and staying power in a market that has "radically changed" and lacking in clarity  i recognize it is not an easy decision to change a decision that has already been made  however  i also consider you a risk taking  strong and capable leader who wants to make the right decision for its ultimate customers in spite of short term political decisions  that will get changed  by governor davis

9.0	nothing about bankruptcy is easy  and because of enron's size  ours is especially complex  so it is understandable that there might be confusion among employees of enron's various debtor and non-debtor companies surrounding the bankruptcy  to clarify  debtor-in-possession  or debtor  companies are the legal entities of enron that have filed for bankruptcy - their business activities are subject to the review and approval of the creditors' committee and the bankruptcy court  non-debtor companies are legal entities owned or controlled by enron that have not filed for bankruptcy - for the most part  non-debtor companies are able to operate their business as usual  the estate is made up of the combined assets and liabilities of enron  which include some holdings in non-debtor companies  it is important to note that at the beginning of march there were approximately        enron employees in non-debtor companies  and about       enron employees in debtor companies  distinctions between debtor and non-debtor companies become especially relevant for employees as we begin to roll out components of a transitional compensation program  as we work through restructuring  components of the program will apply differently to employees of debtor and non-debtor companies  for example  earlier this year some non-debtor companies were able to pay performance bonuses and merit increases to their employees as part of the ordinary course of business  another example is severance  going forward  we can anticipate gradual reductions in our workforce  given the uncertainty of our situation  we realize the importance of providing a "safety net " severance provides employees a degree of financial security in the event their jobs are terminated in the future  some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute a new severance plan for their employees  this was possible because the plan did not require the approval of the bankruptcy court  while the severance plan for debtor companies will be different than the plan for non-debtor companies  severance is part of a comprehensive retention and severance plan that will go to the bankruptcy court for approval  employees of debtor companies will be covered by either severance or retention  retention will become part of the compensation program for some employees  primarily those in debtor companies  retention offers employees an incentive to stay with the company to help develop a new business entity  to liquidate non-core assets  or to unwind the affairs of the estate  retention is not a measure of past performance  but is intended to retain key employees whose skills or historical knowledge are critical to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors  additionally  we are now finalizing merit increases and promotions for employees of debtor companies  supervisors in those companies will soon begin communicating merit increases or promotions to their employees  we hope this information further clarifies the bankruptcy's impact on our individual businesses  but more importantly  we hope it helps to establish realistic expectations and reduce some uncertainty for you as employees  to review a current list of enron's debtor companies  click on the following link  http   home enron com updates filedentities html

6.0	herewith a few ideas for the october meeting in london  some of them after checking with paul portney and with pankaj  i offer these very  very preliminary thoughts just to start you thinking - do you want your uk colleagues on the program  do we want some ancillary events  after getting your views on questions such as these  i can make more definite suggestions  i certainly think that we should convene a few hours before the opening dinner so that the advisors can have a tour of the building and the facilities  also  i am hoping that steve will leave some time on this trip for a tour of the new ba headquarters - very innovative  we should consider doing something on the global warming question from the viewpoint of the europeans  start with three recommendations on the political side that paul received from david victor of the council on foreign relations  characterized as "a very smart guy on climate"   tony brenton  deputy chief of mission  uk embassy in dc  has been on uk climate delegations for a decade  smart and lively  pragmatic  insightful   bo kjellen  swedish head of delegation  knows european politics inside out  big figure in europe   tubiana  laurence  conseil d'analyse economique  france  knows the issue and can speak to french position  but may not have the gravitas of kjellen or brenton   among other ideas  i have winnowed out several  is a guy named liam salter at climate network europe  brussels based  but relatively junior  paul also recommends a woman by the name of laurence tubiana  an economist in the french government's equivalent of the cea  she has a reputation as a good presenter and a good economist  would you please check these folks out with your london people  and get additional names from them  the goal is to give all of us a perspective on the european view on environmental issues - unless you think that not a useful topic  i turn now to pankaj's suggestion  which i transmit verbatim  "i remember promising to scout around and see if there were a european whom it would be interesting to invite to talk to the enron international advisory council about the  non  convergence of governance structures in europe  particularly on the continent  to the u s  model  i got the following names from jay lorsch  apparently all members of the committee steering a multifaculty harvard business school project on governance in comparative perspective  as possibilities  jay suggested that sihler would be best  former ceo of henkel  very senior   peter's second best  apparently  chairman of amsterdam stock exchange now  and smith - formerly managing partner at price waterhouse coopers - would be the most junior of the three  i don't personally know any of the three " now some ideas of my own  again acting on the assumption that we want a two-way educational dialogue - to give your folks in london and europe a run-down on the situation in the us  and the us contingent a better understanding of how european policymakers view the issues we all face    bill kristol on the us political scene  in which there is great interest here  and great misunderstanding of the bush administration  we might also consider inviting larry lindsey or some other bush person if allowed to do so     someone on the european view on global warming  see suggestions above      energy regulation in the uk  callum mccarthy     economic outlook  gavyn davies  usual talk      what went wrong in california  great interest in that over here  and how to fix it  steve could do this  or you could invite bill hogan  just joking  or the chairman of ferc if we are allowed to pay his way     motivating people in a multinational  multicultural organization  if this is of interest  i can get recommendations for speakers     i would be inclined to add a high-level speaker on the state of us-uk-european relations  perhaps as a dinner speaker  between gavyn and me  we might be able to get chancellor gordon brown  a very interesting guy  and the inventor of the "climate change levy" that is driving industry in this country nuts  please look this over  steve and i have to get together  preferably with ken  which leads me to suggest aspen during the institute's energy forum  which i understand ken will be attending  but if that is not feasible  steve and i can work out a date for a preliminary meeting  followed up by one with ken at his convenience  end

14.0	as you know  enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron  we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing  even though enron has entered into this agreement  u s  and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other  in particular  to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets  their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed  therefore  for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement  in addition  all information  documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller  lance schuler  robert eickenroht  mark haedicke  rob walls or greg whalley of enron  it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained  to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement  then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals  if you have any questions concerning this notice  please contact lance schuler         -       robert eickenroht         -       mark haedicke         -      or rob walls         -       thank you for your help in this matter

6.0	i just talked to chris kennedy  she informed me that amoco will be taking down their liquids line that feeds the wattenberg plant for the entire months of august and september  what that means is that the gas flows into cig at watkins box elder will be reduced  she says by     but i don't know if that's entirely correct  this hurts us on the thermo deal  delivered to skyline  due to the fact that these two receipt points are the only points that work on our discounted transportation  i don't think we will have too much trouble buying dj supplies during the peak of the summer but keep your eyes open for any watkins box elder supply  we also need to start working cig for a discount on other receipt points  paul ps make sure if you are using the cig skyline discounted transportation at receipt points other than watkins and box elder we are requesting discounts for these additional points  otherwise we will be paying max rate

6.0	bob and i just spoke with steve susman  i tried to mention the points you asked  here are his comments     f j probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with arthur anderson  susman believes that there is a "hot potato" rule that prevents f j from doing so     that being said  susman doesn't care if f j represents arthur anderson or anyone else potentially adverse to us in the actions he is handling     susman would not  however  agree to a broad advance ethical waiver  as proposed by f j  he does not believe such waivers are effective  susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who f j wanted to represent  i don't know whether f j would agree to this or not     susman recognizes that we cannot force f j to take on the new mariner matter  and that this is ultimately a risk benefit decision for us to make  and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldn't agree to  parenthetically  i have received no comments on f j's proposed waiver letter  under the circumstances  from his standpoint  bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with f j  but that if f j won't budge  that we take something along the lines of what they have given us  bob  let me know if i have mischaracterized your thoughts   from my standpoint  i unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed  this would be to the extent that the letter purports to have enron corp  agree to bind all the enron entities  and to the extent that it involves enron's agreement to what will happen after the dynegy merger  as i set out in my earlier e-mail   my recommendation would be  as set forth in my earlier e-mail  that only the enron entities currently being represented by f j sign it and be bound by it  and to remove the language regarding what enron would agree to after the dynegy merger  i also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant  but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made  i do not know whether f j would be willing to make these changes or not  our biggest problem right now is time-management  i know that mariner wanted to make a decision by today as to who to use  i am willing to confer with dutton asap to see what f j would agree to  and if he can agree in principle  to send him a proposed draft agreement  i believe he is out of the office but is checking his voice-mail  please let me know what you want me to do  britt

and jim wyckoff  proprietor of "jim wyckoff on the markets " futuresource com  dave  give us a basic fundamental perspective on the u s  dollar and its major counterparts  hightower  the u s  dollar appears to have an entrenched bullish sentiment over the euro and we would expect interest in the dollar to increase into the kick-off of the physical euro currency implementation  however  it would

second time that the dollar has been quickly repelled from that level  we have been suggesting for weeks that the us dollar is holding an extreme premium versus most of the world's currencies  therefore  a leveling out of economic conditions would seem to pressure the dollar  we also think that the u s  dollar has seen an unsustainable windfall off of japanese yen weakness  therefore  it is possible that the dollar will see a blow-off top in the coming week and that a major top could be formed  historically  it would seem that several major turns in the currency markets have come in close proximity to the beginning of a new year  in the event that the dollar does turn down  we have to think that the canadian and the swiss will see the most significant recovery capacity

higher  after prices had been trending lower during late november and the first have of december  last week  the march dollar index hit a high of         and has since seen some healthy consolidation of the recent strong gains  the dollar index bulls indeed have the near term edge  and the longer-term charts are also friendlier to the bulls  if the bulls can push the march dollar index above the

languish in more of a choppy and sideways trading range in the near term  bulls should be warned that if prices do sell off from here  a big head-and-shoulders top reversal pattern could develop on the weekly continuation chart for nearby dollar index futures  but right now  the bulls are enjoying the technical advantage  as for the euro currency  the weekly continuation chart for nearby euro futures should give the bulls some encouragement  as well as throw a scare into u s  dollar index bulls  a longer- term downtrend line drawn off the      high was penetrated on the upside and negated just about a year ago  since that time  prices have been trading sideways in a choppy pattern  this choppy trading has also formed a coiling pattern--whereby the sideways trading range has become more compacted the past several weeks  this is suggestive of a bigger "breakout-type" price move in the not-too-distant future  given the recent lowly price levels in the euro  odds do favor that potential breakout being to the upside  there is also potential for a big double-bottom reversal pattern on the weekly chart  indeed  there are clues on this chart that suggest the euro currency bulls will enjoy more success in the coming year than they did in the past year  from a shorter-term perspective  if march euro currency futures prices drop down below the november low of        then the door is opened to much more downside  if that low can hold and prices work higher  then a big double-bottom reversal could be in the works  finally  the japanese yen has been in a nosedive for nearly two months  this steep decline appears to be a "washout" or exhaustion-type selling phase that many times precedes a major change in trend  but bottom-pickers should beware  right now  would-be long-side traders do not want to stand in front of a steaming locomotive  they should first let the market show them some solid signals of strength before attempting to board the bullish train  futuresource com

5.0	this is an alert that ferc will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals  the orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that tennessee  anr and columbia had done  these provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates  but ferc has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative  thus  anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny  ferc adds another layer to policy on negotiated-rate authority acting on a series of contract-specific cases  ferc last week sharpened its policy on what is  and is not  allowed under negotiated rates  in further defining its policy  the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates  during discussion of the orders  chairman pat wood iii said it was "important to keep in mind  as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side " that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines " last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend " he asserted  in representative language  the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment  ferc declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers  in cases involving rates negotiated by anr pipeline co   gt  -    rp  -      tennessee gas pipeline co   rp  -     et al   and columbia gas transmission corp   cp  -     the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs  the provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals  while the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package  "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates  it said in the tennessee order  where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity  recourse service provides an "adequate alternative " the commission observed  "however  if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff  the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute  since recourse service would not include any such provision " a shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk  giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers " the commission pointed out  "a shipper's right to reduce  or terminate  its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right  since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges " ferc said  adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner " requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated" in a fair manner  ferc reasoned  once approved  the tariff language "will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers " commissioner linda breathitt applauded the policy shift  characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become "muddled " through a "tortured line of cases " ferc's definitions of allowable contracting practices were "obscured " breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense" approach  the "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers  she said

19.0	i am pleased to announce that a new feature is being added to the e-tag system  the potential adjust list  pal   as you may or may not know  there is currently an "adjust list" that is issued when tlrs are called  an "adjust list" is a recommendation from the idc that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve needed relief to eliminate a constraint  this adjust list sent out to generation and load control areas and tag authors for all transactions that are being recommended for curtailment  it is intended to aid in coordination control area schedules during curtailment  as well as alert the marketplace of recommendations for their transactions to be curtailed  under the current process  the adjust list notice is sent out when the initiating security coordinator and all impacted security coordinators have agreed to recommend specific curtailments  as such  this recommendation can occur very late  leaving very little time for the market to react  i e   resource and or resink their power   the potential adjust list feature adds a second  earlier adjust list that is sent out when the initiating sc requests relief  but prior to the confirmation of all the impacting scs  this should allow this recommendation to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today  giving more time for the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks  when all impacted scs confirm  the standard adjust list recommendation is sent out as it is today  it should be recognized that both the potential adjust list and the standard adjust list do not represent actual curtailments - in both cases  they are only recommendations for curtailment  control areas may elect to curtail different transactions or amounts than reflected in either adjust list due to local relief procedures or other business practices  however  both lists should aid in mitigating risk associated with physical transactions and curtailments  further  empirical evidence seems to indicate that in the majority of cases  the potential adjust list  standard adjust list  and final curtailments will be very close  this change is based a proposal i wrote with the help and support of jim eckelkamp  carolina power and light   mark scheel  dynegy   and patt terris  exelon power team   if you talk to any of them during the course of daily business  please thank them for their support of this effort  with their assistance in developing the concept  ironing out the technical details  and cultivating nerc support in the various forums  we were able to implement this change very quickly  i expect this change to take place sometime between june    and june     attached  please find a message from nerc that describes the feature and how it works  if you would like more detail  please let me know  i currently chair the group that is responsible for improving e-tag  and as such  am intimately familiar with tagging and its functions  in the next few weeks  i will be working with don baughman and juan hernandez to ensure we utilize this feature  and others  to maximize the value of our e-tagging tools  as indicated above  please feel free to contact me with any questions 
5.0	as you know  enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron  we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing  even though enron has entered into this agreement  u s  and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other  in particular  to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets  their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed  therefore  for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement  in addition  all information  documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller  lance schuler  robert eickenroht  mark haedicke  rob walls or greg whalley of enron  it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained  to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement  then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals  if you have any questions concerning this notice  please contact lance schuler         -       robert eickenroht         -       mark haedicke         -      or rob walls         -       thank you for your help in this matter

14.0	ken i know it has been several years since we spoke  but i wanted to thank you   for your kind note  and to personally thank you for the opportunities that   enron has provided to me over the years  i am one of those few who was already with hng in       and still vividly r  emember the day that you arrived  the building was immediately permeated b  y a sense of urgency and excitement  that pace was relentless - and addict  ive  i also remember in detail the internorth merger in       and feel pro  ud to have played a part  however small it was  in that transaction  the late     's and the early     's will probably always be my favorite ye  ars of my working life  there were so many initiatives in enron in their i  nfancy  although it was an initiative that faced insurmountable economics   and ultimately failed  i am grateful that enron gave me the opportunity to   participate in the natural gas vehicle adventure  i never really understoo  d until that adventure the full meaning of the old axiom that the lessons l  earnt best are those learnt from adversity and from making mistakes   i will try to remember enron with those years through the mid-    's in min  d  i have to say that i consider those to be the best years  because i hav  e witnessed a degradation of the corporate culture in the past few years    that is clearly a subjective assessment  and should be treated as such  i   am under no illusions  enron is a business entity operating in markets and  environments that are relentlessly competitive  with a primary responsibil  ity to its shareholders  but i and many of my colleagues who also have lon  g tenure at enron and its predecessors share this assessment  i am always   amused by the irony of the stated value "ruthlessness  callousness and arro  gance do not belong here"  since these appear to be the key defining person  al characteristics of most of the senior management of ena in recent years  and unfortunately  the very sale of hpl by enron has been for some an examp  le of the degradation of corporate culture  for myself  i know what to exp  ect - i know that with corporate divestitures comes the need to control inf  ormation as the transaction evolves  but for the "rank and file" - those w  ho live from paycheck to paycheck - it has not been a pleasant experience    they maintained their professionalism  indeed many of them probably worked  harder than anybody else to make the transaction happen   in return  ther  e has been an appalling lack of timely information and misinformation from   enron management and hr department with respect to their benefits and caree  r choices  hr in particular has been totally non-responsive to individual   inquiries in the past few months - not returning phone calls and emails fro  m hpl employees with questions  even after the transaction was announced    even as recently as the past couple of days  only upon receipt of their ter  mination packages did several dozen employees discover that they had been m  isinformed by hr with respect to some aspects of their remaining enron bene  fits  for myself  my years at enron will remain a high point of my career  it is  a badge of honor in the energy industry to have been a dealmaker at enron   particularly for as many years as i was there  i know enron will continue  to set the standards by most measures in this industry  and  for what its   worth  i humbly wish you continued success

14.0	as you know  enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron  we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing  even though enron has entered into this agreement  u s  and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other  in particular  to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets  their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed  therefore  for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement  in addition  all information  documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller  lance schuler  robert eickenroht  mark haedicke  rob walls or greg whalley of enron  it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained  to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement  then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals  if you have any questions concerning this notice  please contact lance schuler         -       robert eickenroht         -       mark haedicke         -      or rob walls         -       thank you for your help in this matter 
5.0	attached is the second draft of enron's comments to ferc on icap  the structure of the paper is summarised below     rto's are a positive step forward for the industry     spot markets are a necessary part of rto development to ensure that the rto can manage real time realiability     a well functioning spot market eliminates the need for separate capacity type products such as icap  reserve margin  i e  it achieves the objectives of icap   the paper incorporates theoretical and emperical evidence from other sectors of the economy and deregulation in other parts of the world to support this conclusion     during the transition from a regulated environment to rto's there may be a 'political' need for icap  specifically states that any interim proposal should be limited to   years after rto implementation     if that is the case  the paper sets out the two common theoretical platforms which can be used as a basis for icap     proposes two options based on the theroetical platforms  we would appreciate input on two issues  firstly  enron needs to make a decision on whether to limit our position to reliance on spot markets  i e  don't suggest an interim solution   while this is attractive  it is unlikely that enron will get support from other participants  icap payments subsidize generation investment so no support from ipp's and consumers are not as confident as enron that competitive markets will maintain reliability so they will want to sustain icap   secondly  drafting comments on the paper generally  please note that the final section  that proposes the enron solution  requires substantial redrafting which will be done if the consensus is to propose such a solution  a final draft will be sent out on the morning of tuesday        the paper will be filed wednesday

14.0	today  enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview   of the company  here's an update of what we discussed during the call  we told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter  ests and to regain their confidence  our focus remains on our credit qualit  y  balance sheet and liquidity  which are essential for our continued succe  ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses  it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today  here's a snapshot   of significant events that led to our current situation  -- in hindsight  we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co  re businesses over the past several years  those include investments in azu  rix  india and brazil  they have performed far worse that we could have eve  r imagined when we made these investments  -- because of these bad investments  we've become over-leveraged as a compa  ny  the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex  tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet  -- we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in  vestor confidence  which has been very damaging  -- we've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under  stand financial and operating disclosures  and -- on top of it all  we discovered errors in our financial statements  as d  iscussed in our  -k filing last week  that required a restatement of previo  usly reported earnings  we've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three  areas  core businesses  non-core businesses  and businesses under review  core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear  nings and cash flows for the company  they're our competitive advantage  th  ese include  -- natural gas pipeline businesses  -- gas and power businesses in north america and europe  -- retail businesses in north america and europe  and -- coal businesses in north america and europe  the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou  r projected fourth quarter profitability  it's too early to tell at this ti  me what impact this might have on our operating results  we are considering  these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in         i also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple   of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity   concerns  according to our business unit leaders  we have definitely seen i  mprovement in our counterparty relationships  non-core businesses our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d  ivision  we have invested more than $  billion in these businesses  and the  return from them has been dismal  we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect   that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash  that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses  we alre  ady have more than $    million in assets contracted for sale this year  th  ey include ceg rio  a gas ldc in brazil  ecoelectrica  a power plant and ln  g receiving terminal in puerto rico  and asset sales of offshore oil and ga  s properties in india  the approximately $    billion portland general sale  is also on target to close in late      pending regulatory approvals  businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga  s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets  while sev  eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects  we need to dete  rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff  icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation  reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make  reductions to our work force  more information will follow as soon as it b  ecomes available  credit rating   -q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that   our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba  lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating  our current cr  edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows  -- moody's at baa  "under review for further downgrade" -- fitch at bbb- "evolving status" -- s p at bbb- "creditwatch negative" we also discussed our existing financial vehicles  including osprey  marlin  and yosemite  in further detail  we told investors that we will file our     -q five days late due to our current activities  it will be filed on nov        we will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we  ll as our frequent updates with you  the full transcript of our conference   call will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in the next   few days  it will also be posted on our web site at www enron com corp

mcgregor  neil subject  weekend update next week thoughts here is an update plus my thoughts on what we should consider this week  i hope to be able to discuss this on monday's call  as this involves some press updates and thoughts regarding the lenders  i am sending this to ben and ranabir as well   i  press reports in weekend newspapers after friday renegotiating meeting -- reports were mixed on renegotiation meeting and possibility of success to find a solution  more credible papers  times of india  dpc phase ii should be scrapped  panel tells enron economic times  enron panel meet fails to make breakthrough  state weighs termination notice to dpc other papers who follow dpc closely  financial express  dpc to meet panel on may     renegotiation is only way out for dpc  cut in tariff likely business standard  dabhol not averse to tariff renegotiation so the press is all over the map on the outcome of friday's meeting  ii  press reports from delhi with goi reaction  summary  goi hopeful that solution can be found between dpc and gom but  goi makes clear in sunday papers the goi position  while goi not opposed to allowing dpc power sale to  rd parties  neither goi nor ntpc will purchase power from dpc  iii  message to lenders  lenders want to know we are serious about finding solutions  we are  and are willing to engage in dialogue so long as willing buyers of power are at table  this was made clear in friday's meeting  but renegotiating committee is not serious about realistic solutions  evidence of this is chairman's view that dpc  and thus its lenders and shareholders  should get no recovery for the lng infrastructure  rather  he strongly believes tariff should be  as reported in godbole committee report  the lowest of any gas-based power plant in country  including those few with pipeline gas  second  goi is not serious yet  as they did not even bother to send someone to meeting  iv  steps forward  for consideration  a  issue ptn  whether to do it with or without transfer notice to be discussed separately on monday  b  when ptn issued  press statement to be issued to cover -- after several months of meetings and proposals  no serious response by mseb  gom and goi parties are still not meeting their contractual obligations  even after both indian and int'l lenders have written to goi thus we are taking steps to protect contractual rights by issuing ptn regarding future meetings to discuss project  project was designed as baseload to meet mseb requirements and approved by gom and goi  project must have buyers for power to have serious negotiations renegotiating committee position  which is reiteration of godbole committee report  is unrealistic if mseb  gom and goi are not willing to meet their contractual obligations to offtake power  then not feasible to discuss any changes to deal  thus prior to any further meetings  dpc awaits specific proposal from mseb gom goi on who they propose to substitute for mseb as the party who is contractually obligated to purchase the power from dpc the prior point is important in that we need to  a  set the going forward agenda with respect to any further meetings and  b  manage expectations regarding such future meetings and who will deliver what proposals  if any  not us   c  bring in senior management asap after ptn rationale is to both feed our ideas into the goi as well let lenders know we are committed to finding solution  including bringing our senior management to india for meetings i recommend we bring ken lay with rebecca to meet in delhi with prime minister  finance minister and power minister  along with sonia gandhi  other meetings can be scheduled as well  and we will want to include some add'l meetings in delhi and mumbai  but above are the key meetings  key message to be delivered --    or    options face the project terminate  and we are willing to go that route rather than have to invest significant additional money into a project in the india power sector that does not currently work buyout of foreign debt and equity and allow an indian solution to be found  renegotiate on our terms  including goi taking   power blocks and ifis funding all additional project costs  my earlier e-mail on renegotiation possibilities might provide some ideas here   the reason i mention this option here is that if we ever think we might have to table a renegotiation option  having ken   rebecca do it at the highest level is the way to go  the solution  regardless of which of   options will be chosen  must be handled at the highest level  and i think it is now  right after ptn  or never to bring in ken and rebecca to see if the solution is there as well as let our lenders know we are seriously taking one more run to try and find a solution  after we bring in ken and rebecca  if the goi still remains on the sidelines and does not step up  the phase i lenders should realize we have done everything we can and give us the transfer notice approval  the quicker we bring in ken and rebecca  the quicker we should have the strongest argument for the transfer notice approval  one logistical point  i do think it is very important to bring in ken and rebecca very quickly after the ptn is issued  but we will need some advance time to set up these high level meetings as well as get indian approvals to bring ken's plane into india  this will take about a full business week  so i think we should schedule this trip as soon as we can -- perhaps during week of may     d  at same time as senior management comes in  have senior contacts from wash  dc contact political leaders in delhi to request a solution be found quickly to avoid any implications on improving india us relations e  finally  i also think it is time for enron to strongly consider an approach directly to some possible buyers  there are   indian corporates who would be leading candidates  there are also some international majors that would be possible  enron could consider a joint asset package of  dpc metgas  the tara is the real value here  depending on the appropriate enron internal approvals    other assets could be considered offshore oil   gas assets data center on the last   items  i know that one of the indian corporates would be interested in the oil   gas assets  and both would be interested in the data center  we could arrange meetings with senior management of potential purchasers when ken   rebecca are in india  or  to avoid press  we might want to schedule these either in low-key india locations or even outside india  dubai or singapore    we can discuss these thoughts on monday  wade

6.0	the differences we had on friday were mainly volume related  correcting the deal in sitara and unify relates to volume actualizations  it is not pricing related  as we talked about there are still some issues on the redwood gas  redwood gas is the gas relating to the underdelivereis  in otherwords  when palo alto "burns" less than we actualy schedule on the transport  presumably we sell this gas to other  rd parties  and palo alto will be reimbursed for the variable transportation  i do not think ther are additional fees we would pay on top of reimburseing them for the variable costs  but i am not      certain  please let me know if ther are any other questions  thanks

6.0	i suggest we talk first  call me on the following cell phone    -   -        the difficulty i suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the  unknown  but in    days we will have everything nailed down  additionally   people  it would appear  seem to be making certain assumptions about the e  state which i believe are false  i can't see the estate continuing to spons  or green cards  or in maintaining the cash balance plan  at least in the fo  rm of the past  etc   etc   bankruptcy isn't pleasant      i would however  like to avoid selling netco at the estate's expense  as di  fficult as this may be      the main points we need to communicate and build around would be      salary - everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at   least at current levels job responsibility - this is entirely jay and jenny's call  if they see a p  erson as necessary to do a different job  they need to explain that  typica  lly  people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the curr  ent have  that would be the whole point of why netco needs them  clearly ne  tco will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite th  e same prominence it enjoyed with enron pre-bankruptcy  unfortunately  that  is lost forever  bonus - plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than enr  on's current arrangement  if we perform  retention - two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of   cash to be paid to the     people in netco who didn't get anything in nov    this would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a com  mitment for them to stay for   months or so otherwise they will have to rep  ay it  benefits - these will differ depending on who buys us  however  it each cas  e they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different  on the sp  ecific point of pension plan  they have plans that require some vesting per  iod but again the   main counter parties have agreed that they will take en  ron service into account  i e  if they have   years with enron and their pl  an requires   years service to vest they will vest immediately  but obvious  ly will get just their first years contribution   now is someone is   years  in with enron  i recognise this is not a great answer  but has to be contr  asted with how long there is a position in the estate for them  i e  is the  re a job for another    months   the last point concentrates too much on ne  gative aspects of what may happen to estate  so i would prefer to avoid too  much innuendo here  visa's - we have a plan to switch all h b visa's within    hours  this is a  pparently straight forward and neil and tim callahan and i have discussed l  ogistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail  on l 's  these wil  l take up to   weeks to switch to h 's  of the    people identified who hav  e visa's only about   or   have l 's  tindall and foster tell us this will   not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the cou  nter-parties who have agreed our approach  these people should avoid travel  ing outside us in this   weeks  but according to tindall and foster will be  legit  green cards - no easy solution  essentially these will have to start from s  cratch  the counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they wil  l support new applications  however  bear in mind i do not believe the enro  n estate will continue with green cards  although this has not been officia  lly proclaimed  expat terms - these will probably be honored by the new company  although e  ach counter-party has indicated a desire to "normalise" the terms with thos  e of their own company  over time  employment agreements - we have identified     across netco  the estate pla  ns to transfer these to the buyer  but it is clear that each prospective bu  yer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal  as such my working   assumption is that the offer letters each netco ee receives circa jan     w  ill supercede all previous terms including employment agreements  that indi  viduals may have had  specifically  i expect that the new employer will not  honor future equity  cash retention  target bonus or severance provisions   that may be in people contracts  clearly  there may be some negotiation her  e      now  we have other things like title's  prc  promotion dates  salary review  s  project bonuses  all employee stock option programs  etc   to figure out    but i think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises  after al  l the new employer will be probably one of the   biggest investments banks   in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over  the last    years  there may even be an ability to transfer  after a while  to a different part of their organisation  if they have an internal postin  g process       as to process from here  we want to identify those who don"t want to go and  why  i want to avoid anyone receiving an "offer" to switch and not accepti  ng it  as i mention above  many of the terms of the "offer" are unlikely to  be a huge surprise  and if people have genuine concerns i want to switch t  hem out now for someone who does want to go  we should have      acceptance    not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early wh  o had concerns  solving them or switching them out for someone else      jeanie amy michelle neil -

22.0	ken  greg  mark - thank you for your leadership over the last several weeks and this morning  we appreciate it  following are some additional thoughts and some more detail on my comments from this morning  the leadership group in that room needs to feel the sense of responsibility to lead our businesses  everything we say   do - including all written  verbal and "body language" - are signals  we must communicate and lead all day  every day  as an organization  and as part of our culture  we lead with our chin - always have and probably always will  we are going to take our share of bumps and bruises  we have some great businesses here    and we are fortunate  we have grown the size and profitability of our core businesses substantially  and in a market where many companies have not been as successful  most of our wounds are self - inflicted  we can and should do a better job  i believe this leadership team needs to make an absolute commitment in the following areas  vision - define what we want this company to be in the next  -  years value - as part of building the world's leading company  my vote is that we dedicate our energy towards building long term  sustainable value  this is not about just creating value in the eyes of wall street - this is about creating real value  perhaps as defined by "after tax operating profit minus the real cost of capital"  market cap will follow this type of economic value creation  we need to measure it and incent people this way  teamwork - we are a leadership team  i don't feel as though everyone buys into that nor is it clear that everyone around that table feels a sense of responsibility to lead across the business  i would like to discuss how we improve as a team  many of our employees  at an average age of    years  have never been through  an economic downturn a global military conflict problems like the ones we are currently experiencing at enron we need big time leadership now    from all who are around that table clear demonstration of our leadership - in clear view of our employees  customers and shareholders people - we must make sure to retain and enhance the interest of the employees that add value to enron everyday  these people need to believe - with our actions - that we are absolutely focused on making sure they have an environment that is conducive to building and creating value over the short  medium and long term  the ball is in our court  we have to lead and be perceived as credible leaders  we've got to dig deep and get down the road - together  if you wish  i would be pleased to discuss this further  thank you again for your leadership  regards - dan

6.0	for purposes of an accelerated distribution from the psa  a "single sum distribution " in section     means that a psa account is distributed all at once  as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement  section     is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant  a psa account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock  additionally  any portion of a psa balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under sections     and     and exhibit a of the plan  this section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of psa balances created with deferrals of restricted stock  the plan indicates that upon death  disability  retirement or termination  the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election  therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan

6.0	as i mentioned in my previous e-mail  on october    dynegy filed a complaint against comed  this proceeding may be of particular interest to enron given ees's plans to offer physical delivery in illinois in early       i've outlined dynegy's principal arguments below  dynegy requested fast-track processing  so any intervention and comments we file are due friday  oct      in order to file a timely intervention  and meaningful comments  if we decide to comment   i need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible  elizabeth and harlan  i'm copying you because i would especially like to know what you think of dynegy's characterization of the firm ld product  main argument  dynegy challenges comed's published business practice that allows "marketer firm"  firm ld  contracts to be designated as network resources  dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the oatt provisions that    network resources are generation "owned  purchased or leased by the network customer designated to serve network load " and    a network customer "must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract" in order to designate a network resource  dynegy's theory on why firm ld should not be a network resource  - permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others  creating reliability problems - firm ld under the eei contract is not capacity-backed  nor is it a commitment to purchase generation - allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity - since retail providers are allowed to rely on "over-the-counter" firm instead of securing long-term contracts  adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load dynegy claims that comed's practice has deprived dmg of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources  it cites specific instances in which comed has accepted transmission reservation requests from new energy and cilco in which these parties designated illinois power as a network resource  when only a firm ld contracts were in place with ip

14.0	yesterday  enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas  our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline  dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron's right to repurchase until june     we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy  while we would like to keep northern natural  we still have some       miles of safe  profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses  the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $   billion damage claim against dynegy  it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts  we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas  below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services  ken dear ets colleague  on thursday  enron entered into a settlement over dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline  the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy  in this respect  enron corp  has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas  consequently  enron corp  has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy  while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved  the company has concluded that with this settlement  enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly  as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court  for the northern natural gas employees  i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable  successful business  beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe  reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas  over many years we have run high quality  cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets  keep up the good work  stan

14.0	as you know  enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron  we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing  even though enron has entered into this agreement  u s  and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other  in particular  to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets  their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed  therefore  for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement  in addition  all information  documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller  lance schuler  robert eickenroht  mark haedicke  rob walls or greg whalley of enron  it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained  to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement  then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals  if you have any questions concerning this notice  please contact lance schuler         -       robert eickenroht         -       mark haedicke         -      or rob walls         -       thank you for your help in this matter
