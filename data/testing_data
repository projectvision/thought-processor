6.0	michelle  can you and the comp team help us identify who has contractual bonus targets for performing at the top          or     of the prc "criteria" or "performance scale"  obviously we have a number of contracts we entered into between jun    and the beginning of the end of last year which have some sort of wording along the above lines in them  there are some critical questions i would like to get clarity on  if bu's and support functions simply stop at          in their prc's how will we deal with these contracts  presuming all commercial staff are also relative ranked for bonus purposes separately to the prc  can we use this scale instead  where it will be easier to identify a to half or quartile performance   do we need to ensure that bu's and functions that have people with such wording do split their middle      if so how should we do this  do we need to amend those contracts to wording that is easier to interpret  what proof or disclosure will we need to those individuals with this wording  i have a prc committee meeting thurs and while i don't anticipate raising this issue in that forum  i'd like to know we are working on a solution  david
6.0	tim we are currently using aps transmission to satisfy a llh short position at pinnacle peak  the revenue associated with the sale at pinnacle peak is MONEY  the transmission is used to liquidate a long position at four corners     against the pinnacle peak short position  the cost of the power purchased at four corners is MONEY  using the aps transmission is the most economic liquidation scheme at this time  our alternative would be to sell the length below the market value  and buy the short at above market value  this assumes that we could find a willing buyer and seller  the spread between the purchase and sell price in this scenario is estimated at MONEY  the cost of the aps transmission is MONEY  salt river has the facility to provide the same service  but at this time they are unwilling to provide service to enron  if you have any further questions please contact me

5.0	listened in on the analyst call TIME  here are my notes  did not yet have a chance to organize them  so they're simply in chronological order  the call began with watson  bergstrom  and whalley reading from prepared statements  watson spoke for c     minutes  bergstrom for    and whalley spoke for perhaps    seconds  dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call  enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them  specific points  ees will be a part of the new company  enron assets will be revalued at closing  the investment in northern natural takes the form of convertible preferred  if the merger does not go through  dynegy has the right to acquire northern for 'very little' additional consideration  if dyn terminates the merger and ene 'has sufficient liquidity'  ene has right to repurchase the convertible preferred  debt equity of combined company expected to be       both companies will remain on ratingswatch negative  chevrontexaco will hold    mm shares out of a total    mm shares of the post-merger entity  watson reiterates that going forward  the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure  with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage  in what was termed a "new approach"  the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings  rumors that dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to enron are not true  dynegy owed enron  MONEY  mm  lay says that enron had other options  'particularly financial'  all of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks  lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big'  but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure  lay says we have nothing else to hide  but internal investigation still under way  lay  had the spes been capitalized with perhaps MONEY  mm more of risk capital  there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the spes  dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at enron  and thus dyn ene cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there  doty  dynegy cfo  says that late last week  ene had 'close to a billion' in cash  osprey will be unwound late next DATE  marlin will be unwound after closing  many of the off-balance-sheet structures  including the credit-linked notes  are expected to be unwound redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing  with regard to ene asset dispositions  these will be accelerated to the extent possible  however  doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall'  and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash  ene will renew its    -day facility  believe this is the MONEY bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago  within the next  -  weeks  bbb-flat most likely rating for combined entity  according to initial comments from ratings agencies  mcmahon says 'no comment' to wsj article indicating that ene's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ene in the next few weeks  consolidation of trading activity  mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing  such that only the front office   trading books will need to be combined at closing  ees  nng and tw have no real overlap with existing dyn activity  so there won't be much integration work required there  the big integration effort will be ena  watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets  doty adds that  'frankly'  dyn assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model  they bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets businesses and left it at that  watson mentions that dyn would not have gotten involved with enron had they not been approached by 'enron's top three executives'  who said that they thought a combination with dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies  says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with dyn to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger  watson doty said that they're not      sure that no surprises remain in enron's books--but that the risk reward offered by the combination was compelling  the deal does have material-adverse-change outs for dynegy  covering any mac regarding enron's assets or businesses  dynegy's lawyers indicated that the mac language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case  so dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the enron's total legal liability  from any source or cause of action  tops MONEY prior to closing  mcmahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements  but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements  ene international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list  the merger structure calls for a new entity to take over enron  enron is planning to hold an enron-specific conference call in the next few days  tentatively scheduled for DATE  initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities  mcmahon acknowledges that enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end  had the merger not materialized  dynegy's earnings guidance places enron-related earnings accretion at MONEY    -      which represents a '    haircut' to enron internal estimates  doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies  doty says that both enron and dynegy's books  as far as he understands  are relatively short-term in weight  and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity  says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash  chevrontexaco's investment in dynegy was calculated at a    discount to public prices on the date of negotiation  not disclosed   given the runup in dynegy stock last week  chevrontexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices  chevrontexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'   no further clarification given   whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the enron traders and marketers  they're used to being part of a winning team  and the combined entity will definitely be a winner  they have talked with most of the enron business leaders  and they are 'very excited' by the combination  they will be working with the enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained  whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions  he says that 'to the extent necessary  yes ' watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of dyn and ene--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus  but by the same token the new dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the dynegy of today  watson says that if there were to be any change in culture  he's a strong team player  he does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well  give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments

 times week  sometimes more often  the outside auditors  d t  and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually   days a week'  lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation  mcmahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for  that analysis is underway  but it will not be complete for some time  osprey contains the european power projects  trakya and saarlux   some north american merchant investments  and some brazilian assets  under the merger agreement  enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than     of the balance sheet without dynegy approval  however  an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without dynegy approval  broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'   did not catch this part clearly   the ene topup obligation for marlin  represented by ene common that would have to be delivered  will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of dyn shares upon closing  MONEY of debt is carried at the azurix level  current book value of the osprey assets is MONEY  no dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general mac clause and the MONEY legal liability clause  yosemite and the credit-linked notes are functionally equivalent to ene senior unsecured debt  this section somewhat unclear   the underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'  the transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities  the swaps related to yosemite and the clns would be financially settled  whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes  he said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products  acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold DATE  says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels  it will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us  mcmahon  there hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers  but 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions  some of the flows ' whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week  lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses  the situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure  he says  the cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses  whalley then quickly interjects  some might say interrrupts  with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our north american energy trading business  we will be looking at  perhaps  streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments  but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business  mcmahon  "the company is overlevered  that's a fact "--hence our pursuit of additional equity  mcmahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of DATE  ene had approx  MONEY in cash as of       which mcmahon points out would be unusual for us  as before  give me a call at  -     if you'd like more color

22.0	ken  greg  mark - thank you for your leadership over the last several weeks and TIME  we appreciate it  following are some additional thoughts and some more detail on my comments from TIME  the leadership group in that room needs to feel the sense of responsibility to lead our businesses  everything we say   do - including all written  verbal and "body language" - are signals  we must communicate and lead all day  every day  as an organization  and as part of our culture  we lead with our chin - always have and probably always will  we are going to take our share of bumps and bruises  we have some great businesses here    and we are fortunate  we have grown the size and profitability of our core businesses substantially  and in a market where many companies have not been as successful  most of our wounds are self - inflicted  we can and should do a better job  i believe this leadership team needs to make an absolute commitment in the following areas  vision - define what we want this company to be in the next  -  years value - as part of building the world's leading company  my vote is that we dedicate our energy towards building long term  sustainable value  this is not about just creating value in the eyes of wall street - this is about creating real value  perhaps as defined by "after tax operating profit minus the real cost of capital"  market cap will follow this type of economic value creation  we need to measure it and incent people this way  teamwork - we are a leadership team  i don't feel as though everyone buys into that nor is it clear that everyone around that table feels a sense of responsibility to lead across the business  i would like to discuss how we improve as a team  many of our employees  at an average age of    years  have never been through  an economic downturn a global military conflict problems like the ones we are currently experiencing at enron we need big time leadership now    from all who are around that table clear demonstration of our leadership - in clear view of our employees  customers and shareholders people - we must make sure to retain and enhance the interest of the employees that add value to enron everyday  these people need to believe - with our actions - that we are absolutely focused on making sure they have an environment that is conducive to building and creating value over the short  medium and long term  the ball is in our court  we have to lead and be perceived as credible leaders  we've got to dig deep and get down the road - together  if you wish  i would be pleased to discuss this further  thank you again for your leadership  regards - dan

9.0	for the first time in    years of service for enron i'm ashamed to admit th  at i work for enron  i have lost all respect for enron senior management a  nd agree with the financial analyst when they say that enron senior managem  ent can not be trusted  ethics and morals are either something everyone el  se needs to have except senior management or somewhere along the way senior  management started believing the end justifies the means  the communicati  on the employee's have received over the last few years about values such a  s respect  integrity  communication and excellence must be propaganda inten  ded to get employee's to believe senior management really supported these v  alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som  ething just the opposite  i can not believe that senior management lacks the understanding of human n  ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha  ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in  the future  then to allow an enron spokesperson to speak for enron with t  he statement "it's just a balance-sheet issue" implies to me that this ind  ividual does not know what a balance sheet or income statement is and certa  inly should not be speaking to the public  if you are going to play the ga  me of lying  cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen  t a plausible story  to use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua  ting values in some of enron's broadband telecommunications and other techn  ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini  tion of the word "hedge"  a hedge by definition implies that the upside an  d downside exposure has been limited  it frightens me that we are out aski  ng customers to let enron help them "hedge" their risk when i'm not sure en  ron's senior management understands what a hedge means  i'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of andy fastow i  n the investment vehicle that generated this write down  i must be confuse  d in that as a trader enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that i  will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the  natural gas business  this must be an example of as my father used to say  " do as i say not as i do"  i guess we need to have audits performed of se  nior managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as   their word  the fact that senior management and the ene board of directors knew these t  ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and   took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ene stock options in my opin  ion is "criminal"  it provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp  etrators of this fraud have left enron in recent months  these individuals  have stolen MONEY from ene stockholders and employees and ne  ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity  they are set for life  h  aving all the money they could ever need  while employees and stockholders   have lost their life savings  you have completely failed at the job you we  re hired to perform  if this type of activity would have occurred farther   down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve  d and to institute criminal charges      i for one can not wait until the all employee meeting next week  i do not   think anyone wants to hear about DATE results because how could we  trust what is said anyway  instead i feel you owe the ene employee's a th  orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities  what  actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor  mance to date

19.0	gentlemen - following the dabhol dictate that "bad news is good news " dabhol is getting some good news this week  as reported in the press  dpc did receive a two-page letter from mseb purporting to rescind the ppa with immediate effect because dpc materially misrepresented the capabilities of the power plant  i e     hour actual ramp-up time vs    hour ramp-up schedule in the ppa   however  the letter goes on to state that mseb is "agreeable to continue the present arrangement of power and payment until disputes are resolved by the appropriate forum " we are not entirely sure what this last part means and are asking mseb for clarification  obviously  this letter is quite a buttress to our already-delivered ptn contending that mseb has evidenced an intention not to be bound by the ppa  while mseb's letter seems to state that they will still honor some aspects of the ppa  the letter adds that "payments would be subject to adjustments on the basis of determination of reasonable compensation and quantum meruit by a competent authority " we hear rumors that mseb will approach the maharasthra energy regulatory commission  merc  for a "how much should we pay dpc" determination  if they do so and merc accepts jurisdiction  this would help our expropriation  political force majeure and default arguments  dpc seems to have managed to avoid a construction contractor termination in may by agreeing to extend the required completion date for block b by   days  while this action does not have long-term benefits to the project  i believe that it was a considerable sign of good faith that dpc is trying to give the lenders some time to assess whether they want to begin curing project agreement defaults on an ongoing basis  bruce

5.0	as requested  mark baldwin has put together a summary of the proposed decision and comment points for filing on DATE  below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference TIME  having reviewed the proposed decision i would agree with mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the commission not modify the comprehensive settlement  overall the modifications made should not negatively impact transwestern  the proposed decision retains two important aspects of the cs for transwestern     unbundling of the socal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and    retention of primary firm rp capacity of    mm d at needles from transwestern  gh -----original message----- from   mbaldwin igservice com  enron sent  DATE               pm to  hass  glen subject  bilas   proposed decision socal gir glen  i have reviewed the          revised pd of comr  bilas as requested  in view of the entirety of tw's interest  i still ascertain that tw can support the current       pd  noted below for your information and review is a summary of the modifications to the csa that bilas is currently offering     market concentration limits reduced from     to      of available receipt point capacity  tw has preferred no limits to market concentration historically  however  as before  i do not believe pushing this issue will be successful or productive for tw  there are no market concentration limits in the secondary market   although bilas warns market participants that any misbehavior will be subject to cpuc investigation  p      socal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized firm rp capacity  i don't see any negative impact on tw  perhaps positive  p      price cap for secondary intrastate market set at       of socal firm rate  this is the same cap that applies to socal  i don't like the precedent set in this area  however it assures that the economic value allocation between socal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the interstate system providers in any tight transport supply scenario  p      not really a change   but bilas mentions support for hector rd  as a delivery receipt at ferc    pd does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels  current level      mmcfd  proposed      mmcfd on the interstate system and current storage    bcf      mmcfd of injection and       mmcfd withdrawal vs proposed    bcf  i see no clear negative impact on tw from this change p             cta's  core transport agents  allowed to reject only their prorata share of non-reliability storage service  no impact on tw interests  p        socal directed to present via advice ltr   how the cost of noncore default balancing will be allocated only to those noncore customer using this service and not to the core customers  i see no impact on tw  p      pd rejects the requirement that socal sdg e file an application with a proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider  i see only positive attributes of this change for tw  p      preserves the right for socal sdg e to seek recovery of expenditures associated with the transfers of customers from core to core aggregator  no impact on tw  p       pd orders a      cap on itcs  stranded cost responsibility borne by bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity  no direct impact upon tw interest  however  likely a touchy point with noncore interest  p         pd orders that the core contribution to noncore itcs will end effective the adoption of the pd  additionally  noncore customers to pay     of core itcs till the end of the core tw and epng agreements  no negative impact on tw  noncore customers bear additional expense  the pd estimates an additional MONEY over next   to   years  p     the pd provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between    and    to be approx  MONEY      pd say no to an increase in the core brokerage fee of MONEY   no impact on tw interest  p         pd treats core subscription service differently on an accounting basis  no impact on tw  p   -      generally  the pd makes some administrative changes to the small core esp market rules and socal services and consumer protection implementation   no impact on tw interest  p   -        lots of tweaking on how socal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the csa  owing to the fact that socal has already started to "implement" portions of the csa and those cost are accruing to a balancing account etc  bottomline  not consequential to the approval of the pd  no direct impact upon tw interest  p     -     on whole the centerpiece of tw's interest in this proceeding remains intact  the socal receipt points are unbundled along with "socal backbone facilities"  tw has primary firm rp of no less than     mmfcd  mojave is recognized at only    mmfcd firm rp  no receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion  line     appears to remain useful for tw deliveries into the market load centers  the pd modifications to the csa do not impose upon tw any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support the pd  the parties most affected by the pd are the core aggregators with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore customers with additional cost allocations  points for comments    tw agrees with the pd that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the csa in the creation of firm tradable rp rights  this change in socal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts     further adoption of the pd substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the california border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty     the creation of tradable secondary rights on socal's intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices     the pd correctly observes that the pg e market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during california's challenging energy markets    tw agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the pd  the energy markets in california have been improving and stabilizing  the commission promising options are still valid in today's gas market  further  socal is already starting to follow the csa game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the socal system  it is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these improvements    tw supports socal and others whom are approving this pd   on this point  tw should be sure that socal is on board as well as other csa signatories  prior to filing these type comments  i look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call  mark  igs  mark  igs

6.0	as i mentioned in my previous e-mail  on DATE    dynegy filed a complaint against comed  this proceeding may be of particular interest to enron given ees's plans to offer physical delivery in illinois in early       i've outlined dynegy's principal arguments below  dynegy requested fast-track processing  so any intervention and comments we file are due DATE  oct      in order to file a timely intervention  and meaningful comments  if we decide to comment   i need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible  elizabeth and harlan  i'm copying you because i would especially like to know what you think of dynegy's characterization of the firm ld product  main argument  dynegy challenges comed's published business practice that allows "marketer firm"  firm ld  contracts to be designated as network resources  dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the oatt provisions that    network resources are generation "owned  purchased or leased by the network customer designated to serve network load " and    a network customer "must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract" in order to designate a network resource  dynegy's theory on why firm ld should not be a network resource  - permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others  creating reliability problems - firm ld under the eei contract is not capacity-backed  nor is it a commitment to purchase generation - allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity - since retail providers are allowed to rely on "over-the-counter" firm instead of securing long-term contracts  adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load dynegy claims that comed's practice has deprived dmg of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources  it cites specific instances in which comed has accepted transmission reservation requests from new energy and cilco in which these parties designated illinois power as a network resource  when only a firm ld contracts were in place with ip

6.0	martin  subsequent to my last e-mail i discovered an additional detail which may po  ssibly clarify why ence prefers to purchase the chilean e  globulus species  to the brazilian species for pulp production  it would appear that the e   globulus species holds up better than the various brazilian species during  the refining process  while most papermakers generally don't refine hardw  oods and softwoods with the same equipment  many smaller european mills are  unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingl  y do use a single refiner for all grades  this is particularly true of the  italian mills  since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining req  uired for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics  opaci  ty  etc    these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suit  ed for this type of processing  accordingly  the globulus species  which i  s also the predominant species in the iberian peninsula  holds up much bett  er under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus  in any case  i hope this helps shed additional light on this issue  and  as  always  please feel free to revert with any questions you might have  tha  nks

available at the sec's website----that is the fastest and most efficient way to access them      sec file number  enron corp - -           total assets and liabilities  i would use our latest   -q filed last week  however  as we all know  these are not only unaudited  we do not have the aa sas    letter  limited review letter required for quarterly financials   perhaps we should consult causey as to the answer to this question  although my best guess would be the DATE financial statements just filed with the sec      debt securities and number of holders---i would have no way of knowing this---i would check with corporate treasury  tim despain  clint freeland and the folks in their group   the group responsible for paying the interest on our debt securities would know the answer to this  and that would be corporate treasury  as to number of holders  they may have to contact the trustee of the debt securities  for most of the public debt securities  i believe that would be bank of new york  as successor trustee to harris trust  enron's long-time trustee      number of shares of preferred stock ---i thought this list was included in the schedules to the merger agreement  but i can't seem to put my hands on the schedules  i will try to get this list to you today or early in the morning  DATE   brenda funk may also have an up-to-date list  the recent preferred stock issuances relate to structured financings  which are deals i don't work on---that's the reason i don't have this info at my fingertips---but i think i can get it for you  tomorrow morning  if not today       as of DATE     according to   -q filed last week              shares of common stock issued and outstanding  this does not include treasury shares---if we need that number  we will have to get from the corporate secretary's office       desciption of enron's business  i agree with you  we can lift this from the current   -q filed last week  anything before that may be out of date       look at the draft of the proxy statement that i sent to you yesterday  the reference to janus is as of DATE of this year---as you know  institutional holders of    or more only have to file an annual schedule   g  on on before feb     of each year   of course  other    or greater owners must file a   d shortly after acquiring their holdings  and i am not aware that we have received a schedule   d lately  the issuer is supposed to receive a copy  as well as the sec   mark koenig in investor relations might have a handle on who enron's current owners are  without a schedule   d  we can assume that no one else owns in excess of          with respect to enron corp  common and second preferred convertible stock  there are literally thousands of holders  i assume the only way to get this information is the shareholder lists from the transfer agent  or  possibly the corporate secretary's office would have this info---if not  they would be the group that knows how to get it        see no    above  jordan and julia  the information that we would need to get from enron's transfer agent or enron's trustees for its debt securities would not be available from those entities until DATE  if we needed it before then  as noted above the best sources of information would be the enron treasury group  with respect to debt securities outstanding  and the corporate secretary's office  paula rieker and elaine overturf  with respect to shareholder lists  i apologize in advance that i will be necessarily out of pocket DATE TIME  but plan to be in the office all day DATE if i can help with

number of shares of preferred stock and approximate number of holders         number of shares of common and approximate number of holders   --i believe that both  s   and   relate to issued  rather

ctively traded on the new york stock exchange  as of   p m  DATE  dyne  gy shares fell MONEY     on DATE  dynegy issued a statement in which chairman and chief executi  ve chuck watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory   approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously  announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on enr  on     under the merger agreement  dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk  away from the deal if enron's financial and legal problems become severe e  nough  however  some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-  called material adverse change clauses  they point to a decision earlier th  is year by a delaware chancery court judge who forced tyson foods inc  to c  omplete a planned purchase of ibp inc  even though tyson  a springdale  ark     food-products company  had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a  drop in ibp's earnings and accounting problems at an ibp unit     dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment  to complete the deal   two-thirds of dynegy shareholders and a majority of enron shareholders wou  ld have to give their approval  no dates for those votes have been set     one person familiar with the merger plans said the sec filing DATE by enr  on contained information dynegy hadn't known about  dynegy

about MONEY  billion at dynegy's current stock price    however  from a price standpoint  the deal is appearing less attractive to   dynegy     on the day of the merger announcement  enron shares were trading at about MONEY       each  or about     of the purchase price under the exchange ratio  as   of DATE  enron's market price was only about     of the merger-formula  price  such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme  nt  when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra  ding relatively close to the offering price     sentiment among wall street analysts also is turning against the merger  in  itially  many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue enron   and provide a major boost to houston-based dynegy  dynegy and enron officia  ls have predicted that the merger  supposed to be completed late next year   would significantly and immediately increase dynegy's earnings     now analysts are challenging that assumption  ron barone  managing director  at ubs warburg llc  said he believes that because of enron's financial pro  blems  a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than  dynegy would have by itself  mr  barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"  is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about       dynegy share for each enron share     such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal  according  to one person familiar with the merger negotiations  dynegy reduced the ex  change formula at least once prior to the nov    announcement because of en  ron's rapidly sinking stock price  which at the beginning of this year was   above MONEY   a share     in perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on wall street  go  ldman sachs analyst david fleischer lowered his ratings on enron and dynegy    a longtime enron fan  mr  fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha  t the merger would help dynegy's earnings and whether enron could "recover   the significant business that has been lost" in its giant energy-trading op  erations  "the enron machine continues to sputter " mr  fleischer wrote     some observers say that if dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren  egotiate the terms significantly  enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l  aw filing  without the dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba  nkers and customers  an enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible "  said ralph pellecchia  a senior director at fitch  a credit-ratings agency    on DATE  fitch maintained its credit rating on enron at just one not  ch above noninvestment-grade  or "junk " status  but fitch also said it bel  ieved enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls"  in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations " contrib  uting to "liquidity pressures "    among the advisers enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir  m of weil  gotshal   manges  which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-  workout situations  asked about a possible bankruptcy filing  an enron spok  eswoman said the company expects the dynegy deal to go through and therefor  e doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger  since the m  erger announcement  enron chairman kenneth lay has said his company had alt  ernatives to the dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them  enron sa  id it made some progress improving its financial position  the company said  it reached a final agreement with units of j p  morgan chase

andersen p  artner who audited sunbeam and against the firm itself in the waste managem  ent case     now enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by ar  thur andersen  in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from  the company's reported profits in recent years  all of which raises the question  has arthur andersen become the black shee  p of the accounting

the former chairman of the securities and  exchange commission  said this week     but if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases  it  is materiality  in all three cases  andersen auditors spotted bad accounti  ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea  d     materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into

decision at the time     to those who treasure the role of auditors  the humiliation of andersen is   painful  back in the     's  it was leonard spacek  andersen's managing par  tner  who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it  was not showing enough independence  his public prodding was crucial in ma  king the industry do a better job  two decades ago  when the issue on the t  able was pension accounting  andersen was the only major accounting firm to  break with clients and push for good rules     now andersen's backbone is open to question  it was evidence that

when he was a partner there and the firm had a s  eries of highly publicized blown audits     ''we got bludgeoned to death in the press '' he said  ''people did not even  want to see us at their doorsteps  it was brutal  but we deserved it  we h  ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls   '' by that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending  clients and not enough to good accounting     for andersen to avoid that fate  its relatively new chief executive  joseph  berardino  who declined to be interviewed for this column  will

proud of serving alongside citigroup as bot  h lead lender and adviser to enron on its acquisition by dynegy  the dual r  ole it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank  wit  h enron's shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidde  n debts  j  p  morgan chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of   other banks while simultaneously keeping the

period a year ago  its stock has dropped    percent this year  more th  an other banks' shares  the bank's stock is ahead of investment banks like   goldman sachs  with which j  p  morgan chase increasingly competes     ''the jury is still out in many respects on this merger '' said judah kraus  haar  an analyst at merrill lynch  nevertheless  he likes j  p  morgan chas  e's stock  he said  because ''expectations are very low ''    all j  p  morgan chase's competitors are suffering from the slowdown on wal  l street  but some  like citigroup  are better diversified and have greater  involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking  which is proving to be a st  rong moneymaker this year     nearly a third of j  p  morgan chase's revenues are consumer-oriented  by c  ontrast  its chief new york rival  citigroup  gets half its revenues from c  onsumer businesses     ''the timing of the merger was bad '' said steven wharton  a banking analys  t at loomis  sayles   company  which owns about a million j  p  morgan chas  e shares  ''there's no disputing that ''    actually  mr  harrison disputes it  ''i can't tell you how happy i am about  having done this merger '' he said in a

senior executive at chemical     still  ms  dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the j  p    morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations     ''in general  mergers are very hard on morale '' she said  ''there is no qu  estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll ''    the bank's executives are making the best of a bad situation  they have tak  en advantage of the slowdown to cut around   percent of the combined banks'  staff  or about       more employees than anticipated at the time the merg  er was announced     many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers  j  p  mo  rgan chase expects that       jobs in its investment banking division will   have been eliminated by the end of the year     ''we have focused on the tougher jobs to cut '' ms  dublon said     in some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for j  p  morgan  chase to overhaul its staff  with fewer jobs available on wall street  mr   shapiro said  the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a  bout changes in their jobs  ''people have fewer options '' he said  ''so yo  u have a little more control over the process ''    thanks partly to these cuts  the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin  g will be MONEY    billion annually  compared with an original projection of MONEY   billion at the time of the merger     the cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits  in the bank's core businesses  ''what we can control and are managing very  aggressively is the expenses of the company '' ms  dublon said in a confer  ence call with reporters on oct      the day earnings were announced     aside from cost cuts  the weakness on wall street makes it hard for the ban  k's executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking  where fees  were down    percent in the third quarter  but mr  harrison points to mark  et-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on wall   street  he hopes that when the investment banking business revives  j  p  m  organ chase will hold on to these gains     the bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas  mergers and ac  quisitions  and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals     the bank ranked  th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising  on mergers during the first nine months of

advising enron came from the old j  p    morgan  but with merger activity slow  there are few such deals to go aroun  d     the bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds

pundits and fund managers were touting "the per  fect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy t  rading business one to watch in       then came the california power crisis  and allegations of price-gouging and  fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group  that wa  s followed by renewed volatility in power prices  and this time the prices   were headed down  not up     and then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the  industry's largest player  enron corp   ene      simply put  the perfect storm stalled  and a business once buoyed by high g  as prices  strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters     the stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto  cks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about   where traditional utilities trade     and the chance for recovery in          basu mullick  portfolio manager of the neuberger berman partners fund  is w  illing to bet there is  he thinks energy traders deserve at least the same   price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median  which is current  ly between   - to   -times future earnings  he said  it's just a matter of   time before the stocks get there     "they were just recovering from gray davis " mullick said  referring to the  governor of california  who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of a  rtificially inflating the price of power in the state  and triggering the s  tate's energy crisis  "now  they are recovering from enron "    the fund manager also blames lower commodity prices  warm weather and poor   demand for the recent weak performance in the group     "energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates " he sai  d  "i don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut  ility "    still  others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet  ween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategie  s and financial disclosures     enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun  ting issues  although many of enron's financial problems aren't solely the   fault of mark-to-market accounting issues  there has been growing attention  paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit  y it can create     answers elude investors    investors are asking hard questions  and not always getting the answers the  y want     using mark-to-market methods  a company calculates the fair market value of  a commodity position - whether it's a contract  an option  a swap  etc  -   at the time  even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe  riod  the problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr  om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o  riginal assessment  also  sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair val  ue of the commodity position  this is particularly true in instances where   the market for the commodity isn't liquid     over time  companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m  ark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa  rts that provide little or no disclosure  said abn amro inc  analyst paul p  atterson     encouragingly  it appears companies may already be responding to the call f  or added disclosure  according to a survey patterson conducted  more compan  ies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their  mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls   compared with those in the second quarter     patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based     "all things being equal  we believe reported earnings that more closely ref  lect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t  hem than earnings that do not " he said     he expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear  nings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market  accounting     at the end of the day  it is not a matter of simply producing profits  but   being able to say where those earnings came from  said one investor  who ma  nages a pension fund     some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the   energy merchants produce     tim o'brien  portfolio manager of the gabelli utilities fund  said energy m  erchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi  ons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi  onal utility companies  still  the stocks should be valued at less than the  growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity p  rices     energy merchants include companies such as dynegy inc   dyn   duke energy c  orp   duk  and dominion resources inc   d      according to o'brien  the group never deserved to have the price-to-earning  s multiples above   - to   -times earnings  which were once paid for the st  ocks     "we all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclic  al these companies are " o'brien said  adding that the average multiple sho  uld be in the high single-digits to the high-teens     as for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated   operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade   in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis o  f the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio  according to o'br  ien     "one analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays "  o'brien said     that could mean stocks such as calpine corp   cpn   which is already

collins jr  said then that vendor problems had slowed development   of the system's front-end technology and caused the delays  but he still ex  pected enymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod  uct line     if nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as enyme  x with access  the new system may end up being known as enymex     "enymex right now is looking for a new mission " said an industry source cl  ose to nymex  "you know how politics works  we don't scrap it  we just rena  me it  anything we do electronically is now going to be called

fund  any lbo firm would need assurance about how it will get its money back on an enron investment  said snow    the thing they have to be cautious about is the exit '' he said    if there's a chance dynegy would agree to buy out  the lbo firms'  stake over time  that would give some confidence  but if the only exit is the public market  that's a little bit dicier '' any private investment also must be large enough to make a meaningful difference  enron's market value is MONEY    billion and dynegy has proposed paying MONEY   billion in stock and assumption of debt  that means the private

msn high-speed internet service have been delayed by a lawsuit from enron corp   which could cost the company customers during the holiday season  analysts said  msn had planned to have fast internet access over telephone lines available  with help from energy trader enron  in    markets starting oct      instead  the service is now on sale in about    markets  said msn product manager lisa gurry  the latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that has delayed the rollout of microsoft's fast internet access service over the last year  the holidays are typically a popular time for customers to buy so-called broadband access  often along with new personal computers purchased or received as gifts    they have a track record of picking broadband partners that don't quite work out '' said joe laszlo  senior analyst at market researcher jupiter media metrix inc    it definitely hurts them with customers who want broadband right now '' subscribers to fast internet access services are expected to grow fourfold by       according to estimates by jupiter media metrix  while sales of slower internet access plans decline  fast internet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line  or dsl  technology  on track gurry said redmond  washington-based microsoft is still on track to have fast access for sale by the end of march to    percent of the    million to    million households that have dsl available in their neighborhoods    there is very little growth left in the dial-up access space for microsoft or anybody  which leaves them with broadband as the only potential growth area for the msn access business '' said youssef squali  an analyst at fac equities  who rates microsoft internet competitor aol time warner inc  a   buy '' microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music and video and software updates  which require fast internet access for smooth downloads  the company originally began a service with northpoint communications group inc   a now-bankrupt provider of fast web access  microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among cable companies who use their networks for high-speed service  now houston-based enron  which agreed in june to provide the backbone for a nationwide expansion of msn's service  is suing  enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn't required to deliver broadband services if microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to build  enron  which is being acquired by rival dynegy inc   recently disclosed debts of MONEY     billion due by      and restated earnings for four years  slower expansion msn has been selling high-speed access in    states under partnership with qwest communications international inc  for the last few months  msn has begun the planned service expansion outside of those states by working with enron competitors that msn marketing director bob visse declined to name  the company is also talking to enron  he said  enron didn't return calls for comment  because of the enron suit the expansion is moving slower than expected  visse said  since oct      msn has added service in los angeles  san francisco  san diego and sacramento  california  and houston  dallas  san antonio and austin  texas  giving microsoft a total of about    markets rather than     plans to expand marketing are also on hold  visse said    it is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are in '' said microsoft chief executive steve ballmer  top u s  internet service provider america online  owned by aol time warner inc   has also been slow to get into the high- speed market  analysts said  that doesn't mean microsoft is in the clear  laszlo said both msn and aol might pay for their sluggishness with tougher competition from third-place earthlink inc  and from cable and telephone companies that have more experience selling high-speed internet access  america online has more than    million subscribers to msn's   million  earthlink inc  has      million subscribers  laszlo doesn't think msn or america online can build the kind of lead in the high-speed market that america online has in the slower dial- up access market   not a permanent blow' not that anyone need worry about microsoft  msn will be able to expand its fast internet access business even with the delays  laszlo said    they are already late in the broadband market so this means they get a little later '' he said    but broadband will continue to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a permanent blow '' analysts also say microsoft still needs to find a cable partner that will let msn use its network to sell fast access over cable lines  cable is more popular than dsl with customers looking for fast web service  the five largest cable providers control    percent of the u s  high-speed internet market  the five largest sellers of access via phone lines and dsl technology account for about    percent  according to market researcher ars inc  microsoft msn vice president yusuf mehdi said last month the company may be interested in an investment in at t corp 's

5.0	internal communication regarding delays in retail competition in texas DATE          the main purpose of this memo is to inform epmi and ees commercial teams regarding the implementation status of retail competition texas  particularly in non-ercot regions  which include parts of the areas served by the following utilities    southwestern electric power company  swepco  and west texas utilities company  wtu  - both in the spp region   entergy gulf states  egsi  - in the energy-serc region as most of you probably have heard  the texas utility commission has been examining  in the last few weeks  the readiness to implement retail competition in those areas  the public utility commission of texas  staff  has filed petitions seeking a determination of whether market institutions are ready for retail competition in above areas  to start DATE           there is a concern among the commission and many other participants that non-ercot-texas regions are not ready for competition  this concern has two major causes  - lack of a vibrant  efficient wholesale market in those regions  where newly established reps could have full access to others suppliers  on a non-discriminatory basis - lack of success in the retail pilot programs developed in      - no alternative suppliers and no customer shifting at all  a recent hearing has confirmed most reps absolute lack of interest in those regions - at least for the time being spp DATE  the public utility commission decided to delay competition in spp texas  or  more accurately  "to delay customer choice"  in the commission preferred language  enron  who was requested to file a testimony  opposed to any delays  under the argument that spp is not a "perfect market"  but reps could trade in this market as other marketers do  no final dates have been established yet  however  one estimates that the delay may vary from    to    months  the commission has established some clear actions and milestones before retail competition is implemented  - support spp to begin wholesale market operations  which involves refinements and upgrades in a few of existing systems  such as settlement  - reform in spp tariffs and implementation of a market based congestion management  - continue the pilot  attract new competitors and open the market  as part of this effort  the commission created a southwest power pool market readiness implementation project  docket          to develop the necessary steps to transition to full competition  identify milestones  monitor progress and report to the commission on a regular basis  enron will be supporting this effort  serc serc regions bear resemblance with spp  in terms of commission's intent to delay competition  the most important difference is that the incumbent utility  egsi  an entergy subsidiary  has strongly supported timely implementation  the commission fears that entergy will benefit from its "monopolistic" position in the region  in the absence of other reps  no final decisions have been made yet  entergy gulf states  in conjunction with the commission staff and other interested parties have gone through a settlement process  whereby retail competition will be delayed until DATE           the subject is still being examined by the commission and no final decisions have been made  however  we expect the commission to approve the settlement agreement  therefore delaying competition until DATE           ercot all the discussion about delays in competition focuses on non-ercot texas only  there are rumors and ongoing discussions about delaying competition in ercot-texas  which is scheduled to take place on DATE           for example  nancy hetrich from enron  will be attending the legislative oversight committee on DATE     she will be appearing in her capacity of chair of rms sub-committee  contrary to non-ercot  there is a strong support from most industry participants to have retail competition on time  besides  the results from the pilots were successful and ercot is supposed to provide vibrant wholesale competition  therefore  unlike spp and entergy  there should be no material reasons or fears to delay retail competition in ercot-texas  we will keep you apprised as things evolve

21.0	dear dr  lay  we met less than a week ago  on DATE    may       during the oecd forum      in paris  i'm an independent consultant and innovator  with a special interest in energy and new technologies  i have more than ten years experience in research and innovation in economics  business and technology  i attended the session on energy you chaired during that oecd forum  after the session  i had a discussion with you  unfortunately  your time was too short  you gave me your card and asked me to write you  as i told you  i think i can add value to your staff  bring new lines of businesses to enron and with them  many new clients  and above all  unprecedented profits  i am writing you to propose my contribution in these purposes  i'm mainly making three proposals to enron    - working for enron as an external consultant  here  i would rather like to work on assignments  medium or long term  with a preference for the following jobs  risk assessment and or management  strategic analysis on geopolitical  macroeconomics and societal issues  i think these are important tasks for a company like enron  the current problems with enron's dabhol power plant in the maharashtra state in india stresses the kind of importance i'm mentioning  i can also conduct surveys and provide enron with technical and fruitful information and policy recommendations  i've done a job like that recently  on the oil-pipeline project in chad and cameroon  as you may already know  this is a MONEY project recently launched  with the support of the world bank  and led by three major energy firms  exxon and chevron of the usa  and petronas of malaysia  i wrote a detailed and long report  which combined public and private sectors' concerns  and also communities' interests  having operations worldwide  enron i think needs the type of technical works i've done on that major energy project  i have a good expertise in energy economics  i attend international congresses on that subject  for instance in boston in DATE       since more than five years  as a journalist or as an independent consultant  i have been covering the works and studies of  or participated to workshops and seminar organized by  the iea  international energy association   i know mr  robert priddle  iea chair  who also attended that energy session during the oecd forum       i know the work he and his team of experts have been doing    - being fully employed by enron  in this respect  i would prefer to work as a researcher for either enron project development and management or capital and risk management departments  in these fields  i've also innovated  i've created among concepts  tools and processes  for instance  the "sensible guide for action"  this is a tool theoretically powerful and practically very efficacious  it's main goal is to help decision-makers  in both private and public sectors  the sensible guide for action assists them in their approach to solve technical problems  the sga is a five-leaf bough  i've also created a method to assess a firm capacity to create wealth  this method can be adapted to fit some particular projects  the method is very useful in countries where there's no stocks market  and where capital markets are not sufficiently large  that's the case of underdeveloped countries in general  where yet the energy demand if forecast to grow the most in the coming decades  enron cannot overlook this  or miss the business and profit opportunities in this growth    - the business of businesses  dear dr lay  if you accept this third proposal  it will probably be the best investment enron has ever made  i'm an independent researcher and entrepreneur  with a strong quantitative analysis competence  and a multidisciplinary background  both by education and professionally  i'm a graduate in mathematics and in mechanical engineering  university of paris  and also in business and economics  institut d'etudes politiques of paris   in this third proposal i'm bringing to enron two key inventions i've made  two types of financial products targeting consumers and companies  i believe they will interest enron  these products have a market potential worldwide  unlimited  they will create an entirely new industry  the business of businesses  i'm currently looking for investors with whom i can launch those products  we will be the world leader here  and remain in that position for a long time before copycats try to reach us  i've created the products  and nobody knows about them or about their extraordinary markets  i started to talk to you about these products when we met  but you were hurrying  and the many solicitations and noises of the forum made it difficult to explain my point  i'm writing you as you asked me  because firstly i believe these products will interest enron  secondly i know how these products will boost three types of enron services  online marketplace  broadband services  and energy   commodities  plus  these products  and the business of businesses they create are an excellent placement for enron  among the many reasons why i believe my products will interest enron are these   i  their market is global   ii  they are directly related to consumption and savings   iii  they're excellent saving vehicles  for instance for pension or life insurance   iv  they concern payment transactions and transmissions  and thanks to information technology  costs here decrease while productivity will grow    v  they are both offline and online business  these products will be excellent for enron e-business    vi  i want to be and remain a global leader   vii  the products' growth potential is borderless  viii  there's no competitor and before copycats arrive we would have strongly imposed ourselves as the leader and the reference  increasing chances that customers remain faithful to us   ix  my products will allow enron to beat its competitors   x  enron will earn a lot of revenues  many new clients  and very big and unprecedented profits  i'm looking for investors willing to put around MONEY  given that the revenues generated can very rapidly reach the range of MONEY to MONEY  that initial MONEY is a wise and very profitable investment  if you're interested  i'm ready to present the products and its business scenario to you  the business model is very innovative  unprecedented  these products' market is the whole world  but the first three markets i would like to attack are the uk  germany and moreover  japan  DATE's news about japan is rather bad  economists and many observers see a declining japan  me not  they may be right from a pure statistical and macroeconomic viewpoint  but they fail to see deeper  they overlook the other face of japan  for my part  i see great business opportunities in japan  DATE and for the coming decade  particularly for the financial products i'm proposing  these financial products i want enron to launch with me in japan  perfectly fit japanese consumption manners  their problematic pension system  and life insurance structure there  public pension systems are under pressure every where  particularly in japan  in germany they are trying to reform it  but there's no consensus in the governments  federal and states'  or in the parliaments  federal and states'   last week  chancellor gerhard schr der won some parliamentary approval  but the package he proposed is far from solving the issue  in the meantime  problems may accumulate  the situation could worsen  what seems sure is that in a foreseeable future  governments  not only in germany but in all developed and ageing countries  will no longer be able to pay pensions at the level they have promised or are continuing to promise  an additional bad news  even company pensions will suffer  in DATE's "financial times"  DATE    may       page      peter thompson  incoming chairman of the british national association of pension funds "warned uk workers that they would no longer rely on comfortable company"  he adds that "many wold have to work until they were    --    years longer than the current retirement age - if they wanted to enjoy a financially comfortable old age"  therefore  workers and citizens should start  right no  to save for themselves  my products are here the best saving vehicle i know  and to what i know of enron  it seems to me that enron's shareholders also will appreciate the kind of new business and investment opportunity i'm bringing to their company  they will allow enron to create a new and unprecedented business model that all its competitors will envy  in a way  enron will change for its advantage  the way to do business in general  and energy business in particular  thanks to the "business of businesses" concept i've elaborated  dear dr  lay  as i read in enron's web site  the list of awards you have received  impressive  congratulations  two qualities common to all of them are leadership and creativity  i wish these will help you to catch the wonderful opportunity i'm bringing to you  in order to allow enron to accomplish a phenomenal progress  leadership and moreover creativity are also two qualities i've been trying to put into practice  this effort creates a sort of affinity between us  thus  i think we can easily understand one another  speaking in some way  the same language  hence an additional reason that brings me to write you and to make my proposal directly to you  given what i've learned of enron's vision and values  i would like to stress four of the twelve headings that are listed in enron "vision and values" page  innovation  diversity  change and excellence  four headings that are at work in each of the three proposals i've just made to you  when i knew you were coming to that forum  i prepared some materials for you and was ready to present my proposals to you in details and to answer all your questions  i'm still ready to do it  i'm even ready to come to houston for that purpose  in one recent enron's ad  i read   "enron  endless possibilities"  let's make it true  let's do it together  let's reap the enormous benefits of "the business of businesses"  thank you

1.0	today  we announced plans to merge with dynegy  a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties  dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own  we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build  following are the major components of the transaction  deal terms -- the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of        dynegy shares for every enron share  for example  each       shares of enron stock will be converted to     shares of dynegy upon closing  plus cash for fractional shares  upon closing  -- chevrontexaco owns approximately    percent of dynegy's outstanding common stock  chevrontexaco will invest MONEY in dynegy immediately and an additional MONEY in dynegy on closing of the merger  dynegy will immediately invest MONEY in cash in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas  -- total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately     million shares  -- the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  and is expected to close late next year  enron will have immediate access to dynegy's MONEY cash investment in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary  management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company  which will be called dynegy inc   and steve bergstrom will be president and coo  i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes  i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman  greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes  then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman  mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron  management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth  efficient integration  the make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined  the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the DATE       this merger will create an enormous growth engine  providing great opportunities for our employees  shareholders and customers  as with any merger  some elimination of positions is almost inevitable  and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company  we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions  clearly  we cannot rule out involuntary separation  but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations  i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible  as i said in my video  this is a day like no other in our company's history  we considered several options  but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence  strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses  i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps  we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at  http   home enron com updates    if you have additional questions  please submit them to questions enron com  mailto questions enron com   we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions  if you receive any calls from the media  please refer them to our media team at          -

 neil subject  weekend update next week thoughts here is an update plus my thoughts on what we should consider this week  i hope to be able to discuss this on DATE's call  as this involves some press updates and thoughts regarding the lenders  i am sending this to ben and ranabir as well   i  press reports in weekend newspapers after DATE renegotiating meeting -- reports were mixed on renegotiation meeting and possibility of success to find a solution  more credible papers  times of india  dpc phase ii should be scrapped  panel tells enron economic times  enron panel meet fails to make breakthrough  state weighs termination notice to dpc other papers who follow dpc closely  financial express  dpc to meet panel on may     renegotiation is only way out for dpc  cut in tariff likely business standard  dabhol not averse to tariff renegotiation so the press is all over the map on the outcome of DATE's meeting  ii  press reports from delhi with goi reaction  summary  goi hopeful that solution can be found between dpc and gom but  goi makes clear in DATE papers the goi position  while goi not opposed to allowing dpc power sale to  rd parties  neither goi nor ntpc will purchase power from dpc  iii  message to lenders  lenders want to know we are serious about finding solutions  we are  and are willing to engage in dialogue so long as willing buyers of power are at table  this was made clear in DATE's meeting  but renegotiating committee is not serious about realistic solutions  evidence of this is chairman's view that dpc  and thus its lenders and shareholders  should get no recovery for the lng infrastructure  rather  he strongly believes tariff should be  as reported in godbole committee report  the lowest of any gas-based power plant in country  including those few with pipeline gas  second  goi is not serious yet  as they did not even bother to send someone to meeting  iv  steps forward  for consideration  a  issue ptn  whether to do it with or without transfer notice to be discussed separately on DATE  b  when ptn issued  press statement to be issued to cover -- after several months of meetings and proposals  no serious response by mseb  gom and goi parties are still not meeting their contractual obligations  even after both indian and int'l lenders have written to goi thus we are taking steps to protect contractual rights by issuing ptn regarding future meetings to discuss project  project was designed as baseload to meet mseb requirements and approved by gom and goi  project must have buyers for power to have serious negotiations renegotiating committee position  which is reiteration of godbole committee report  is unrealistic if mseb  gom and goi are not willing to meet their contractual obligations to offtake power  then not feasible to discuss any changes to deal  thus prior to any further meetings  dpc awaits specific proposal from mseb gom goi on who they propose to substitute for mseb as the party who is contractually obligated to purchase the power from dpc the prior point is important in that we need to  a  set the going forward agenda with respect to any further meetings and  b  manage expectations regarding such future meetings and who will deliver what proposals  if any  not us   c  bring in senior management asap after ptn rationale is to both feed our ideas into the goi as well let lenders know we are committed to finding solution  including bringing our senior management to india for meetings i recommend we bring ken lay with rebecca to meet in delhi with prime minister  finance minister and power minister  along with sonia gandhi  other meetings can be scheduled as well  and we will want to include some add'l meetings in delhi and mumbai  but above are the key meetings  key message to be delivered --    or    options face the project terminate  and we are willing to go that route rather than have to invest significant additional money into a project in the india power sector that does not currently work buyout of foreign debt and equity and allow an indian solution to be found  renegotiate on our terms  including goi taking   power blocks and ifis funding all additional project costs  my earlier e-mail on renegotiation possibilities might provide some ideas here   the reason i mention this option here is that if we ever think we might have to table a renegotiation option  having ken   rebecca do it at the highest level is the way to go  the solution  regardless of which of   options will be chosen  must be handled at the highest level  and i think it is now  right after ptn  or never to bring in ken and rebecca to see if the solution is there as well as let our lenders know we are seriously taking one more run to try and find a solution  after we bring in ken and rebecca  if the goi still remains on the sidelines and does not step up  the phase i lenders should realize we have done everything we can and give us the transfer notice approval  the quicker we bring in ken and rebecca  the quicker we should have the strongest argument for the transfer notice approval  one logistical point  i do think it is very important to bring in ken and rebecca very quickly after the ptn is issued  but we will need some advance time to set up these high level meetings as well as get indian approvals to bring ken's plane into india  this will take about a full business week  so i think we should schedule this trip as soon as we can -- perhaps during week of may     d  at same time as senior management comes in  have senior contacts from wash  dc contact political leaders in delhi to request a solution be found quickly to avoid any implications on improving india us relations e  finally  i also think it is time for enron to strongly consider an approach directly to some possible buyers  there are   indian corporates who would be leading candidates  there are also some international majors that would be possible  enron could

19.0	i am pleased to announce that a new feature is being added to the e-tag system  the potential adjust list  pal   as you may or may not know  there is currently an "adjust list" that is issued when tlrs are called  an "adjust list" is a recommendation from the idc that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve needed relief to eliminate a constraint  this adjust list sent out to generation and load control areas and tag authors for all transactions that are being recommended for curtailment  it is intended to aid in coordination control area schedules during curtailment  as well as alert the marketplace of recommendations for their transactions to be curtailed  under the current process  the adjust list notice is sent out when the initiating security coordinator and all impacted security coordinators have agreed to recommend specific curtailments  as such  this recommendation can occur very late  leaving very little time for the market to react  i e   resource and or resink their power   the potential adjust list feature adds a second  earlier adjust list that is sent out when the initiating sc requests relief  but prior to the confirmation of all the impacting scs  this should allow this recommendation to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today  giving more time for the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks  when all impacted scs confirm  the standard adjust list recommendation is sent out as it is today  it should be recognized that both the potential adjust list and the standard adjust list do not represent actual curtailments - in both cases  they are only recommendations for curtailment  control areas may elect to curtail different transactions or amounts than reflected in either adjust list due to local relief procedures or other business practices  however  both lists should aid in mitigating risk associated with physical transactions and curtailments  further  empirical evidence seems to indicate that in the majority of cases  the potential adjust list  standard adjust list  and final curtailments will be very close  this change is based a proposal i wrote with the help and support of jim eckelkamp  carolina power and light   mark scheel  dynegy   and patt terris  exelon power team   if you talk to any of them during the course of daily business  please thank them for their support of this effort  with their assistance in developing the concept  ironing out the technical details  and cultivating nerc support in the various forums  we were able to implement this change very quickly  i expect this change to take place sometime between DATE    and DATE     attached  please find a message from nerc that describes the feature and how it works  if you would like more detail  please let me know  i currently chair the group that is responsible for improving e-tag  and as such  am intimately familiar with tagging and its functions  in the next few weeks  i will be working with don baughman and juan hernandez to ensure we utilize this feature  and others  to maximize the value of our e-tagging tools  as indicated above  please feel free to contact me with any questions

5.0	we know how interested all of you are in the retention   severance plan  so we want to update you on its status  as many of you know  we have been working with members of the creditors' committee and their consultants since DATE to formulate a retention   severance plan  and we formally presented the plan to the committee on DATE     we had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the DATE  we know that many of you have career options outside of enron and that the retention   severance plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave  we sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed  we're learning that  in bankruptcy  most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed  the committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan  but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns  the creditors' committee fully supports the implementation of a retention   severance plan  such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy  these plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate  the creditors' committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process  to that end  we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee  we intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible  this is currently our top priority  bar none  when we filed for bankruptcy  we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be  unfortunately  that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place  we now know that it takes significant time  resources and effort to understand  identify and gather the massive volume of required details  to formulate that information into a reasonable program  and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation  the process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which enron has been involved  that serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse  we remain committed to working with the creditors' committee until we can reach agreement on a plan  we anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so  and have targeted the week of march    to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court  we will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court  with respect to non-debtor companies  or those companies not in bankruptcy  new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future  in the meantime  we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week  and of course  we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible

i worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my time  MONEY  normal rate is $      i would like to send you an engagement letter this week for up to   weeks or     hours  MONEY   i think we can get it done in less time but the     hours provides some flexibility if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for the hours we use  i am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring options as well as the npv  income  and operational effect for each  to the extent time allows  i will be able to help negotiate and close whatever option you choose  in order for me to offer our preferred rate  it is important to note that i would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis  e g  DATE meetings  emails  and phone vs  being on-site   weeks full-time   even with this flexible structure  i feel confident that we can have the deliverable complete by mid DATE  please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with these terms                           as for the new idea ---- i have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset position market intelligence  it occurred to me that there is an analogy here that relates to pipelines  pipelines have operational "events" that may have market effects  unplanned outage  major minor duration notice  planned outages over a certain volume operation flow order  sols key plants backed in takes over schedule volumes key points linepack levels pressure drops at key points since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through gas needed for operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would be studied and acted  read traded  upon in order to minimize tw's market risk  read generate income   tw can setup a risk management group to execute this idea  it is not unusual for a pipeline to have a risk management function - duke pipeline for example has a vp of risk management for pipelines  these "events" would be studied in the follow way -    determine whether there is a correlation between an "event" and gas prices basis differentials  - based on historical data     for those events that have a strong correlations  develop a trading strategy around the relationship     back-test the trading strategy against historical data - determine profitability     for operational "events" that are applicable  setup a system to execute program trading that is directly linked to scada  secondary benefits of this risk management  trading  strategy  would be developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of selling the capacity physical vs  through basis derivatives   or some combination of both  steve  if you are interested in this idea i can start drawing up a workplan for this study  dave david a  foti accenture      allen parkway  suite      houston  texas              -

14.0	today  enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview   of the company  here's an update of what we discussed during the call  we told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter  ests and to regain their confidence  our focus remains on our credit qualit  y  balance sheet and liquidity  which are essential for our continued succe  ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses  it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today  here's a snapshot   of significant events that led to our current situation  -- in hindsight  we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co  re businesses over the past several years  those include investments in azu  rix  india and brazil  they have performed far worse that we could have eve  r imagined when we made these investments  -- because of these bad investments  we've become over-leveraged as a compa  ny  the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex  tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet  -- we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in  vestor confidence  which has been very damaging  -- we've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under  stand financial and operating disclosures  and -- on top of it all  we discovered errors in our financial statements  as d  iscussed in our  -k filing last week  that required a restatement of previo  usly reported earnings  we've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three  areas  core businesses  non-core businesses  and businesses under review  core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear  nings and cash flows for the company  they're our competitive advantage  th  ese include  -- natural gas pipeline businesses  -- gas and power businesses in north america and europe  -- retail businesses in north america and europe  and -- coal businesses in north america and europe  the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou  r projected DATE profitability  it's too early to tell at this ti  me what impact this might have on our operating results  we are considering  these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in         i also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple   of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity   concerns  according to our business unit leaders  we have definitely seen i  mprovement in our counterparty relationships  non-core businesses our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d  ivision  we have invested more than MONEY in these businesses  and the  return from them has been dismal  we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect   that the sale of these businesses will generate MONEY in cash  that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses  we alre  ady have more than MONEY in assets contracted for sale this year  th  ey include ceg rio  a gas ldc in brazil  ecoelectrica  a power plant and ln  g receiving terminal in puerto rico  and asset sales of offshore oil and ga  s properties in india  the approximately MONEY portland general sale  is also on target to close in late      pending regulatory approvals  businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga  s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets  while sev  eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects  we need to dete  rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff  icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation  reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make  reductions to our work force  more information will follow as soon as it b  ecomes available  credit rating   -q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that   our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba  lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating  our current cr  edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows  -- moody's at baa  "under review for further downgrade" -- fitch at bbb- "evolving status" -- s p at bbb- "creditwatch negative" we also discussed our existing financial vehicles  including osprey  marlin  and yosemite  in further detail  we told investors that we will file our     -q five days late due to our current activities  it will be filed on nov        we will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we  ll as our frequent updates with you  the full transcript of our conference   call will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in the next   few days  it will also be posted on our web site at www enron com corp inve  stors

6.0	michelle  the coal group has a question related to personnel they would acquire from vulcan if they purchased the marketing rights to their coal  in this scenario  there are   marketing employees which would come to enron as a part of the deal  a few things  in this case  i'm assuming these employees would resign from vulcan and enron would extend the appropriate offer  secondly  enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an   mo to   year trial period  at the end of the trial period  if enron returns the marketing rights to vulcan  or current owner   they want the right to re-call these employees  george mcclellan is ok with the right to recall  but i am not sure how where to put this in writing ie  in the deal agreement  offer letter  etc  thanks  shanna

 weeks  bbb-flat most likely rating for combined entity  according to initial comments from ratings agencies  mcmahon says 'no comment' to wsj article indicating that ene's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ene in the next few weeks  consolidation of trading activity  mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing  such that only the front office   trading books will need to be combined at closing  ees  nng and tw have no real overlap with existing dyn activity  so there won't be much integration work required there  the big integration effort will be ena  watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets  doty adds that  'frankly'  dyn assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model  they bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets businesses and left it at that  watson mentions that dyn would not have gotten involved with enron had they not been approached by 'enron's top three executives'  who said that they thought a combination with dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies  says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with dyn to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger  watson doty said that they're not      sure that no surprises remain in enron's books--but that the risk reward offered by the combination was compelling  the deal does have material-adverse-change outs for dynegy  covering any mac regarding enron's assets or businesses  dynegy's lawyers indicated that the mac language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case  so dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the enron's total legal liability  from any source or cause of action  tops MONEY prior to closing  mcmahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements  but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements  ene international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list  the merger structure calls for a new entity to take over enron  enron is planning to hold an enron-specific conference call in the next few days  tentatively scheduled for DATE  initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities  mcmahon acknowledges that enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end  had the merger not materialized  dynegy's earnings guidance places enron-related earnings accretion at MONEY    -      which represents a '    haircut' to enron internal estimates  doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies  doty says that both enron and dynegy's books  as far as he understands  are relatively short-term in weight  and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity  says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash  chevrontexaco's investment in dynegy was calculated at a    discount to public prices on the date of negotiation  not disclosed   given the runup in dynegy stock last week  chevrontexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices  chevrontexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'   no further clarification given   whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the enron traders and marketers  they're used to being part of a winning team  and the combined entity will definitely be a winner  they have talked with most of the enron business leaders  and they are 'very excited' by the combination  they will be working with the enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained  whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions  he says that 'to the extent necessary  yes ' watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of dyn and ene--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus  but by the same token the new dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the dynegy of today  watson says that if there were to be any change in culture  he's a strong team player  he does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well  give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments

11.0	michelle  all efforts to try to get mo to reduce his contract pay and end the separation negotiations have been unsuccessful and on DATE  th  he sent me an e-mail stating that he has decided to continue his garden leave with full pay   benefits and will await "enron's notification regarding termination according to his employment terms " we were prepared that he would come back with this and we will continue to pay him  but it's this last statement about the notification of termination that concerns me  i would have thought that our presentation of a separation agreement to him back in DATE would have been enough written "notification" that we do not wish to continue his employment past the contract end date  but in speaking with him further  he seems to think that its not  his contract states that if the company terminates your employment without    months written notice  then the company shall pay you the remainder of your salary for the    months from the date it gave your notice  in a lump sum  his contract end date is           and the last thing we want to do is to pay him additional money  please let me know what your legal interpretation of this notification clause is and whether or not we are required to give him a formal termination notice  thanks cathy

5.0	DATE          ferc enacts major constraints    on wholesale market by will mcnamara director  electric industry analysis aep  entergy corp  and southern company told by ferc to charge cost-based p  rices instead of market-based prices for wholesale spot transactions      news item from reuters  the u s  federal energy regulatory commission  fer  c  voted  -  last week to adopt new rules to measure market power  as a con  dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe  r in the wholesale market  ferc commissioners said the new test would impro  ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the california market   DATE  when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight   supplies  ferc commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base  d on supply margin assessments  which examines a company's importance in se  rving peak electricity loads  "if you're big enough to control the market a  t the time we look at it  you'll have mitigation put on you " said ferc cha  irman pat wood     analysis  many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry   are still reeling from ferc's new ruling  which may have slipped past some   radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday   weekend  this is a mammoth ruling on ferc's part  however  and it holds tre  mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share   of their profits coming from wholesale transactions  in addition  state reg  ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates   which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin  king profits in their wholesale operations  while ferc has presented this r  uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience  d in the california market  the new limits on wholesale transactions can al  so be seen as another example of the "big stick" that the commission is usi  ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat  ions  rto   further  the ruling is another striking indication that chairma  n wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m  arkets while still attempting to support competition  the objective represe  nts a tall order  and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom  pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading     put into a nutshell  ferc has ruled that some companies can no longer charg  e unregulated  market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions  i  nstead  companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of  an approved rto must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committ  ed in a long-term contract  and publicly disclose those cost-based prices    columbus  ohio-based american electric power  nyse  aep   atlanta-based sou  thern company  nyse  so  and new orleans-based entergy corp   nyse  etr  ha  ve been singled out as case studies on which ferc will be immediately apply  ing its new standards for wholesale transactions  note that mirant corp   a  former subsidiary of southern company  has also been identified as having   to submit information to ferc in order to gauge its level of market power s  eparate from its former parent  the commission has essentially determined t  hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the  areas in which they operate  under ferc's new market power "test " a gener  ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici  ty is "pivotal" during peak demand  which enables the company to demand a p  rice above competitive levels  regional transmission constraints will also   be considered now as a measurement of a company's market power  this is a d  ramatic departure from previous standards  by which  under one of ferc's ma  in criterions  a company that supplied less than    percent of the power ne  eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l  evel     there are some important exceptions to the ruling  first  ferc has not elim  inated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where t  he grid and markets are controlled by a ferc-approved rto  this is signific  ant  as i will expand upon subsequently  because it indicates that there ar  e secondary objectives in ferc's new ruling  in addition  the current rulin  g only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities  are involved  in other words  long-term contracts that the three companies  may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im  pacted by the ruling  however  the three companies named in the ruling will  have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts  and ferc   has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term co  ntracts may be necessary  also note that the western market  which already   is under a price mitigation policy that ferc imposed in DATE  was not inclu  ded in the new ruling     the three utilities named in the ruling now have    days to submit proposal  s to ferc outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for  all power not currently committed to a buyer  specifically  the utilities   will have to post on their open-access same-time information systems  oasis    the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour   in a   -hour period  moving forward  the price that the utilities can charg  e for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between  their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region  that their power displaces  the new cost-based rates must be administered   by an independent third party     the new pricing standards revert back to an older  cost-based technique kno  wn as "split the savings " the methodology for this standard can get rather  complicated  but essentially under ferc's new ruling the three companies i  dentified will have to post their cost-based  incremental costs for spot po  wer into the oasis system for viewing by potential purchases  purchasers wh  o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci  ng or buying the power on their own  the final price for the transactions w  ill be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decr  emental bid  for instance  if southern company bids its incremental cost at  MONEY and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at MONEY  the transact  ion price would be MONEY  assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day  se  llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da  y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by   p m  what this potent  ially creates is an "information advantage" for buyers who have six hours t  o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers  some of t  he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price  information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th  e purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original in  cremental bid and competing around the seller's price     note also that in a separate development ferc simultaneously opened a broad  investigation under section     of the federal power act to apply the new   market-based-sales policy to all u s  sellers nationwide  what this means i  s that  although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order    it is expected that ferc will continue to take steps to constrain what it b  elieves to be erratic wholesale markets  reportedly  some    companies are   awaiting similar reviews by ferc to determine if the commission believes th  ey exert market power  the     investigation reportedly also requires power  providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within      days to provide ferc with open-ended authority to order refunds if the c  ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred     i made a previous reference to the "big stick" that ferc is carrying relate  d to participation in rtos  remember that a few months ago  chairman wood h  ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an rto the benefits of  charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli  cations  advantages that the chairman equated with the "new world" of the d  eregulated energy market  with this in mind  note that only southern compan  y  entergy and aep are included in the present ruling  although it may be s  ubsequently expanded   southern company and entergy in particular have exhi  bited some resistance in following ferc's consolidation mandate regarding n  ational rtos  so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti  lities have been singled out  this must be particularly painful for souther  n company  which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an  d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov  er the next five years     interestingly  commissioner linda key breathitt represented the single diss  enting vote in the ruling  breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been  pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu  ate the impact on wholesale markets  this issue will undoubtedly be contest  ed  and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to   have been caught off-guard  aep  entergy and southern company all issued st  atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t  he ruling would impact them  and that they were reserving the right for pos  sible litigation     moreover  to summarize the commission's rulemaking  i think there are a han  dful of important points that should be considered  first  the ruling illus  trates the steps that ferc is taking to revoke market-price authority that   was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that pat wood assumed   his post as chairman  second  ferc is implementing cost-based prices on the  spot market only  and in only very defined circumstances  however  this co  uld be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to o  ther wholesale transactions  including long-term contracts  at a later time    third  the "split the savings" cost-based formula could become fraught wi  th its own problems  its requirements are rather complex and it offers the   potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov  er power sellers  which will now be required to post incremental costs in t  he bidding process  finally  one of the inherent drivers of ferc's new ruli  ng is its desire to have large utilities join the rtos that the commission   has approved  it is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact  s aep  entergy and southern company  utilities that have not only been deem  ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a  lso not yet joined an approved rto  however  even though only three compani  es are immediately impacted by this ruling  it should not be overlooked tha  t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi  ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain   areas  thus  overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s  ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power  market are conducted     an archive list of previous issuealert articles is available at www scientech com  http   secure scientech com issuealert

6.0	bob and i just spoke with steve susman  i tried to mention the points you asked  here are his comments     f j probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with arthur anderson  susman believes that there is a "hot potato" rule that prevents f j from doing so     that being said  susman doesn't care if f j represents arthur anderson or anyone else potentially adverse to us in the actions he is handling     susman would not  however  agree to a broad advance ethical waiver  as proposed by f j  he does not believe such waivers are effective  susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who f j wanted to represent  i don't know whether f j would agree to this or not     susman recognizes that we cannot force f j to take on the new mariner matter  and that this is ultimately a risk benefit decision for us to make  and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldn't agree to  parenthetically  i have received no comments on f j's proposed waiver letter  under the circumstances  from his standpoint  bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with f j  but that if f j won't budge  that we take something along the lines of what they have given us  bob  let me know if i have mischaracterized your thoughts   from my standpoint  i unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed  this would be to the extent that the letter purports to have enron corp  agree to bind all the enron entities  and to the extent that it involves enron's agreement to what will happen after the dynegy merger  as i set out in my earlier e-mail   my recommendation would be  as set forth in my earlier e-mail  that only the enron entities currently being represented by f j sign it and be bound by it  and to remove the language regarding what enron would agree to after the dynegy merger  i also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant  but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made  i do not know whether f j would be willing to make these changes or not  our biggest problem right now is time-management  i know that mariner wanted to make a decision by today as to who to use  i am willing to confer with dutton asap to see what f j would agree to  and if he can agree in principle  to send him a proposed draft agreement  i believe he is out of the office but is checking his voice-mail  please let me know what you want me to do  britt

14.0	today  we announced plans to merge with dynegy  a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties  dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own  we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build  following are the major components of the transaction  deal terms -- the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of        dynegy shares for every enron share  for example  each       shares of enron stock will be converted to     shares of dynegy upon closing  plus cash for fractional shares  upon closing  -- chevrontexaco owns approximately    percent of dynegy's outstanding common stock  chevrontexaco will invest MONEY in dynegy immediately and an additional MONEY in dynegy on closing of the merger  dynegy will immediately invest MONEY in cash in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas  -- total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately     million shares  -- the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  and is expected to close late next year  enron will have immediate access to dynegy's MONEY cash investment in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary  management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company  which will be called dynegy inc   and steve bergstrom will be president and coo  i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes  i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman  greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes  then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman  mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron  management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth  efficient integration  the make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined  the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the DATE       this merger will create an enormous growth engine  providing great opportunities for our employees  shareholders and customers  as with any merger  some elimination of positions is almost inevitable  and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company  we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions  clearly  we cannot rule out involuntary separation  but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations  i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible  as i said in my video  this is a day like no other in our company's history  we considered several options  but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence  strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses  i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps  we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at  http   home enron com updates    if you have additional questions  please submit them to questions enron com  mailto questions enron com   we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions  if you receive any calls from the media  please refer them to our media team at          -      i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company  rather than closing doors  we are opening new ones  as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise  including our market reach  financial strength and industry experience  together  we will be a new merchant powerhouse  and again  thank you for everything you have done for enron  investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available  because it will contain important information  investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement prospectus  when it is available  and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron  without charge  at the sec's web site at www sec gov  copies of the joint proxy statement prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either  investor relations  dynegy inc        louisiana  suite       houston  tx        phone           -

6.0	paul  i have been doing some analysis and have found a few problems that should be looked at     the number mother data is pulling for zone p is wrong  the pointer for the data can be found on the sql worksheet the expression is  avg decode prc power reference period cd 'dayahead'  decode pl location name 'pjm' price amt    pjm da  and avg decode prc power reference period cd 'hourly'  decode pl location name 'pjm' price amt    pjm rt  i have looked at the pjm and ny prices and am unable to figure out where the number is coming from     the other   hr desk evidently has been told that the pjm night shift is to prep the pjm and nepool portions of the shift notes  that is fine with me  i wrote a macro to pull  format and print the nepool information  the pjm information is not available on the website  the east power portal has something  i think it does some kind of op sum pull at some unknown interval  the problem is the information is not accurate  rob bensen's frustration with this bad information is the main reason the other   hr desk doesn't want any part of the reporting    a all data points are different than the one hour averages calculated in edata  this makes me doubt that opsum is the source  as edata also pulls from opsum    b when all interfaces and hubs are printing the same  the prices shown differ in the same hour on the website  i have no idea where this information is coming from but it is not right  if the correct data can be found there is an application that pulls from the database at "m  electric   hour pjm ave pjmsummary exe"  if they could fix this app i would care less about the web site  if they do not want to fix the app i can write a macro to pull the same data from the mother data template  i don't really care how i get the data  i just need to get yesterday's pjm for the shift note  in other news  if you are trading some of the regular products  are you following the da-rt physical moves  if we do man the   hr desk  even if bryce is the day guy  we could cover the da-rt physical  having it part of the   hr desk would seem to make sense because the evening load and more up to date weather forecasts could be used when entering the ny side in the early morning  i only mention this if you are finding yourself too busy trading pjm to spend the same amount of time on the analysis  it is certainly easier to do uninterrupted analysis on the back shift  just a thought

2.0	good news  it sounds like miso will offer a way to handle losses financially  based on their previously filed tariff  it appeared that they would not  but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new attachment m that details how they will handle losses financially  i have not yet seen the new attachment m  so it may be a complex or costly process  but hopefully  it will be fine  now  for the important question  miso does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules  either int or ext  in tag parlance  on dec     i don't think this is an issue for us  i expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules  dropping off losses along the path   if this is not correct  and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions  please let me know asap  also let me know how prevalent that practice is  miso is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on dec     while they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline  they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem  thanks 
6.0	we are nearing the "final" form of the document for further use  i have asked bradford to speak with you regarding use of it for major trading counterparties that may not be investment grade  but with whom credit sees the ability to greatly enhance our liquidity via netting of margin requirements  not the small accounts   two issues     do you think we should write a risk memo concerning the issues surrounding the ultimate effectiveness under the code and "square setoff" rights  basically  the intent would be to clarify that if a court did not enforce the close-out netting  and then did not enforce the square setoff  our collateral position on a trading master by trading master basis could be underwater because we would have netted the positions under the master netting agreement for margining purposes  further to this  the bankruptcy reform aspects of this issue are not moving as previously hoped due to consumer issues and current events     fyi  it has come to my attention this week that global finance has consummated a receivable financing  and desires to consummate additional such financings which conflict with master netting agreements in place  as well as setoff language in trading contracts  and with the general concept of master netting for the future  we are meeting tomorrow with bradford and global finance representatives to gather facts  sort through the issues  and try to resolve what appear to be different objectives concerning trading receivables  from a cash perspective  i would think enron as whole would get more benefit from master netting  dollar for dollar benefit  than loan security  which would never be a dollar for dollar benefit --do you think this is a correct analysis

2.0	attached is a presentation for your review that illustrates a new method for curtailment of transactions that is still based on cpm  but give partial-credit for varying levels of firmness in a stack  as you probably know  when a transaction leg is supported by multiple transmission reservations it is referred to as a "stack" of transmission  specifically  a vertical stack  under the current curtailment procedures under which we operate  such a stack is always valued at the lowest curtailment priority of the stack  in other words  if i combine   mw of firm transmission and   mw of non-firm secondary  my    mw of transmission capacity is now treated as if it all had a curtailment priority of    further  if an off-path constraint occurs  the entire transaction is treated with a priority of    even if every other leg is firm  as i'm sure you can see  this stinks  so i have drafted up a proposal for what i think is a better way of doing this  under the proposal    mw would be treated as priority    while the other    would be treated as firm  this would reduce the size on-path curtailments and off-path curtailments  as far as whether it increases or decrease the number of transactions curtailed  that will depend on several different factors  how prevalent stacking is  how often stacks vary in firmness  etc      please review and give comments  as i plan to present to the idcwg in a few weeks  it is my opinion that this is a good idea  but i want to make sure you all  and any others you think should be asked  agree

6.0	michelle  here is the first response i received from one of our senior partners in sf  i think the best thing such a client can do is to use a reputable security outfit  such as kroll associates  to give the co  a very thorough assessment  i think  quite frankly  that relying on the advice of such an outfit would provide more legal protection than talking to all of the lawyers in the world  although our advice could be an additional benefit  as you know  we have an extensive task force report on workplace violence that would be relevant to this inquiry and could provide the basis for an analysis of this issue  although other areas would have to be explored  i am soliciting comments about the hr consultant you referenced
