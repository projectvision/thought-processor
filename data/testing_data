5.0	DATE         pm eastern time businessweek online daily briefing -- can ubs tame enron's wild traders  daily briefing  news analysis by emily thornton in new york  david fairlamb in zurich  and stephanie anderson forest in dallas back in DATE  dynegy  nyse dyn  http   finance yahoo com q s dyn d t  - news  http   biz yahoo com n d dyn html   had what sounded like a great idea  buy enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity  and immediately become the dominant force in those markets  dynegy fled when enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal  now  zurich  switzerland -based ubs warburg  nyse ubs  http   finance yahoo com q s ubs d t  - news  http   biz yahoo com n u ubs html   is making the same bet  albeit for a lot less money  the question now  will the conservative bank be able to impose swiss order on the rogue texas company's traders  on one level  the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched  enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money  other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up MONEY in pretax profits over the past two years  see bw             enron  how good an energy trader ''   still  ubs had good reason to go for a deal that gave it     of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of     enron employees  obviously  the enron name is mud  and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough  but managing enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder  culture clash  enron may be on its last legs  but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on  say insiders    even after going down in flames  a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability '' says a former enron trader who asked not to be named  competitors doubt that people who earned as much as MONEY a year in the freewheeling  high-risk enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of ubs's massive fixed-income business  although many have signed contracts with ubs that prevent them from leaving enron for an undisclosed period    they're all exploring their options '' says one banker privately  indeed  some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from ubs after it gets going again  ubs says it's not worried about rogue traders    we're confident in the people we have hired '' says michael hutchins  global co-head of credit fixed income at ubs warburg  for the scheme to work  however  ubs must persuade enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices  and that will be tough  one reason enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks  analysts estimate that enron was willing to put as much as MONEY at risk on a trade  vs  MONEY at dynegy or MONEY at duke energy  ubs warburg is willing to put up to MONEY at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner  but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk   anything like that'' on a single trade  ubs'ers abide by tighter controls than at enron    smoothing element '' ubs officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment  that's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income    earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets  so they could work as a smoothing element '' says ubs president peter a  wuffli  that's in fact what motivated ubs to send a small team down to houston when enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing  even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead  the swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly    we don't know how quickly this is going to start up '' says ubs ceo john costas    we'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically '' still  anything associated with enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price    it's not clear how successful ubs is going to be '' says jeff dietert  an analyst at investment bank simmons   co  in houston    and i think ubs knows that  that's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front '' some industry insiders doubt that enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules  but ubs isn't about to change its own way of doing business    entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk '' says wuffli  swiss family enron  don't bet the chalet on it  go to www businessweek com  http   rd yahoo com finance editorial bizwk  http   www businessweek com  to see all of our latest stories

5.0	internal communication regarding delays in retail competition in texas DATE          the main purpose of this memo is to inform epmi and ees commercial teams regarding the implementation status of retail competition texas  particularly in non-ercot regions  which include parts of the areas served by the following utilities    southwestern electric power company  swepco  and west texas utilities company  wtu  - both in the spp region   entergy gulf states  egsi  - in the energy-serc region as most of you probably have heard  the texas utility commission has been examining  in the last few weeks  the readiness to implement retail competition in those areas  the public utility commission of texas  staff  has filed petitions seeking a determination of whether market institutions are ready for retail competition in above areas  to start DATE           there is a concern among the commission and many other participants that non-ercot-texas regions are not ready for competition  this concern has two major causes  - lack of a vibrant  efficient wholesale market in those regions  where newly established reps could have full access to others suppliers  on a non-discriminatory basis - lack of success in the retail pilot programs developed in      - no alternative suppliers and no customer shifting at all  a recent hearing has confirmed most reps absolute lack of interest in those regions - at least for the time being spp DATE  the public utility commission decided to delay competition in spp texas  or  more accurately  "to delay customer choice"  in the commission preferred language  enron  who was requested to file a testimony  opposed to any delays  under the argument that spp is not a "perfect market"  but reps could trade in this market as other marketers do  no final dates have been established yet  however  one estimates that the delay may vary from    to    months  the commission has established some clear actions and milestones before retail competition is implemented  - support spp to begin wholesale market operations  which involves refinements and upgrades in a few of existing systems  such as settlement  - reform in spp tariffs and implementation of a market based congestion management  - continue the pilot  attract new competitors and open the market  as part of this effort  the commission created a southwest power pool market readiness implementation project  docket          to develop the necessary steps to transition to full competition  identify milestones  monitor progress and report to the commission on a regular basis  enron will be supporting this effort  serc serc regions bear resemblance with spp  in terms of commission's intent to delay competition  the most important difference is that the incumbent utility  egsi  an entergy subsidiary  has strongly supported timely implementation  the commission fears that entergy will benefit from its "monopolistic" position in the region  in the absence of other reps  no final decisions have been made yet  entergy gulf states  in conjunction with the commission staff and other interested parties have gone through a settlement process  whereby retail competition will be delayed until DATE           the subject is still being examined by the commission and no final decisions have been made  however  we expect the commission to approve the settlement agreement  therefore delaying competition until DATE           ercot all the discussion about delays in competition focuses on non-ercot texas only  there are rumors and ongoing discussions about delaying competition in ercot-texas  which is scheduled to take place on DATE           for example  nancy hetrich from enron  will be attending the legislative oversight committee on DATE     she will be appearing in her capacity of chair of rms sub-committee  contrary to non-ercot  there is a strong support from most industry participants to have retail competition on time  besides  the results from the pilots were successful and ercot is supposed to provide vibrant wholesale competition  therefore  unlike spp and entergy  there should be no material reasons or fears to delay retail competition in ercot-texas  we will keep you apprised as things evolve

6.0	paul  i have been doing some analysis and have found a few problems that should be looked at     the number mother data is pulling for zone p is wrong  the pointer for the data can be found on the sql worksheet the expression is  avg decode prc power reference period cd 'dayahead'  decode pl location name 'pjm' price amt    pjm da  and avg decode prc power reference period cd 'hourly'  decode pl location name 'pjm' price amt    pjm rt  i have looked at the pjm and ny prices and am unable to figure out where the number is coming from     the other   hr desk evidently has been told that the pjm night shift is to prep the pjm and nepool portions of the shift notes  that is fine with me  i wrote a macro to pull  format and print the nepool information  the pjm information is not available on the website  the east power portal has something  i think it does some kind of op sum pull at some unknown interval  the problem is the information is not accurate  rob bensen's frustration with this bad information is the main reason the other   hr desk doesn't want any part of the reporting    a all data points are different than the one hour averages calculated in edata  this makes me doubt that opsum is the source  as edata also pulls from opsum    b when all interfaces and hubs are printing the same  the prices shown differ in the same hour on the website  i have no idea where this information is coming from but it is not right  if the correct data can be found there is an application that pulls from the database at "m  electric   hour pjm ave pjmsummary exe"  if they could fix this app i would care less about the web site  if they do not want to fix the app i can write a macro to pull the same data from the mother data template  i don't really care how i get the data  i just need to get yesterday's pjm for the shift note  in other news  if you are trading some of the regular products  are you following the da-rt physical moves  if we do man the   hr desk  even if bryce is the day guy  we could cover the da-rt physical  having it part of the   hr desk would seem to make sense because the evening load and more up to date weather forecasts could be used when entering the ny side in the early morning  i only mention this if you are finding yourself too busy trading pjm to spend the same amount of time on the analysis  it is certainly easier to do uninterrupted analysis on the back shift  just a thought

6.0	bob and i just spoke with steve susman  i tried to mention the points you asked  here are his comments     f j probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with arthur anderson  susman believes that there is a "hot potato" rule that prevents f j from doing so     that being said  susman doesn't care if f j represents arthur anderson or anyone else potentially adverse to us in the actions he is handling     susman would not  however  agree to a broad advance ethical waiver  as proposed by f j  he does not believe such waivers are effective  susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who f j wanted to represent  i don't know whether f j would agree to this or not     susman recognizes that we cannot force f j to take on the new mariner matter  and that this is ultimately a risk benefit decision for us to make  and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldn't agree to  parenthetically  i have received no comments on f j's proposed waiver letter  under the circumstances  from his standpoint  bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with f j  but that if f j won't budge  that we take something along the lines of what they have given us  bob  let me know if i have mischaracterized your thoughts   from my standpoint  i unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed  this would be to the extent that the letter purports to have enron corp  agree to bind all the enron entities  and to the extent that it involves enron's agreement to what will happen after the dynegy merger  as i set out in my earlier e-mail   my recommendation would be  as set forth in my earlier e-mail  that only the enron entities currently being represented by f j sign it and be bound by it  and to remove the language regarding what enron would agree to after the dynegy merger  i also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant  but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made  i do not know whether f j would be willing to make these changes or not  our biggest problem right now is time-management  i know that mariner wanted to make a decision by today as to who to use  i am willing to confer with dutton asap to see what f j would agree to  and if he can agree in principle  to send him a proposed draft agreement  i believe he is out of the office but is checking his voice-mail  please let me know what you want me to do  britt

2.0	good news  it sounds like miso will offer a way to handle losses financially  based on their previously filed tariff  it appeared that they would not  but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new attachment m that details how they will handle losses financially  i have not yet seen the new attachment m  so it may be a complex or costly process  but hopefully  it will be fine  now  for the important question  miso does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules  either int or ext  in tag parlance  on dec     i don't think this is an issue for us  i expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules  dropping off losses along the path   if this is not correct  and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions  please let me know asap  also let me know how prevalent that practice is  miso is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on dec     while they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline  they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem  thanks

5.0	fyi    -----original message----- from  cantrell  rebecca w  sent  DATE                am to  concannon  ruth  townsend  judy  lamadrid  victor  muhl  gil  superty  robert  calcagno  suzanne  mcmichael jr   ed  smith  george f   pollan  sylvia s   kinsey  lisa  luce  laura  shireman  kristann  miller  stephanie  lucci  paul t   gay  randall l   sullivan  patti  hodge  john  tholt  jane m   kuykendall  tori  mahmassani  souad  south  steven p   shively  hunter s   grigsby  mike  neal  scott  gomez  julie a   sullivan  colleen cc  steffes  james d   lawner  leslie  neustaedter  robert subject  new ferc policy on negotiated rate deals this is an alert that ferc will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals  the orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that tennessee  anr and columbia had done  these provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates  but ferc has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative  thus  anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny  ferc adds another layer to policy on negotiated-rate authority acting on a series of contract-specific cases  ferc last week sharpened its policy on what is  and is not  allowed under negotiated rates  in further defining its policy  the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates  during discussion of the orders  chairman pat wood iii said it was "important to keep in mind  as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side " that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines " last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend " he asserted  in representative language  the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment  ferc declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers  in cases involving rates negotiated by anr pipeline co   gt  -    rp  -      tennessee gas pipeline co   rp  -     et al   and columbia gas transmission corp   cp  -     the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs  the provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals  while the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package  "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates  it said in the tennessee order  where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity  recourse service provides an "adequate alternative " the commission observed  "however  if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff  the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute  since recourse service would not include any such provision " a shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk  giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers " the commission pointed out  "a shipper's right to reduce  or terminate  its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right  since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges " ferc said  adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner " requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated" in a fair manner  ferc reasoned  once approved  the tariff language "will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers " commissioner linda breathitt applauded the policy shift  characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become "muddled " through a "tortured line of cases " ferc's definitions of allowable contracting practices were "obscured " breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense" approach  the "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers  she said

9.0	as many of you know  i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of MONEY per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron  the merger with dynegy  or a similar transaction with any other company  would trigger this provision on closing  assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within  -  months  as we expect  this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than MONEY  many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since       but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees  i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment  initially  i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash  however  after talking to a number of employees this afternoon  i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment  therefore  at closing  i will receive no payments under this provision  i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face  but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron's employees and shareholders  i am still very proud of what we have built at enron  and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry  thank you

6.0	adele  i reviewed the opinion and there were several changes to the form from the prior draft  i would like to discuss two of the additions with your counsel if that would be ok with you  the first addition at issue is subpart k at the end of the first paragraph on page two  it looks like we may need a representation from you that you are not and will not carry on investment business in or from within bermuda and that you will not perform your obligations under the agreement in or from within bermuda in order for the opinion to have value  the second addition at issue is subpart  e  under section   of the opinion  as written it looks like a large loop hole that can be taken advantage of just by finding evidence that was not submitted at the trial  our general counsel is concerned with what looks like an easy way to circumvent a foreign judgment  i would appreciate your thoughts or any clarification i can get  regards  brent hendry

5.0	listened in on the analyst call TIME  here are my notes  did not yet have a chance to organize them  so they're simply in chronological order  the call began with watson  bergstrom  and whalley reading from prepared statements  watson spoke for c     minutes  bergstrom for    and whalley spoke for perhaps    seconds  dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call  enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them  specific points  ees will be a part of the new company  enron assets will be revalued at closing  the investment in northern natural takes the form of convertible preferred  if the merger does not go through  dynegy has the right to acquire northern for 'very little' additional consideration  if dyn terminates the merger and ene 'has sufficient liquidity'  ene has right to repurchase the convertible preferred  debt equity of combined company expected to be       both companies will remain on ratingswatch negative  chevrontexaco will hold    mm shares out of a total    mm shares of the post-merger entity  watson reiterates that going forward  the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure  with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage  in what was termed a "new approach"  the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings  rumors that dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to enron are not true  dynegy owed enron  MONEY  mm  lay says that enron had other options  'particularly financial'  all of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks  lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big'  but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure  lay says we have nothing else to hide  but internal investigation still under way  lay  had the spes been capitalized with perhaps MONEY  mm more of risk capital  there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the spes  dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at enron  and thus dyn ene cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there  doty  dynegy cfo  says that late last week  ene had 'close to a billion' in cash  osprey will be unwound late next DATE  marlin will be unwound after closing  many of the off-balance-sheet structures  including the credit-linked notes  are expected to be unwound redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing  with regard to ene asset dispositions  these will be accelerated to the extent possible  however  doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall'  and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash  ene will renew its    -day facility  believe this is the MONEY bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago  within the next  -  weeks  bbb-flat most likely rating for combined entity  according to initial comments from ratings agencies  mcmahon says 'no comment' to wsj article indicating that ene's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ene in the next few weeks  consolidation of trading activity  mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing  such that only the front office   trading books will need to be combined at closing  ees  nng and tw have no real overlap with existing dyn activity  so there won't be much integration work required there  the big integration effort will be ena  watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets  doty adds that  'frankly'  dyn assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model  they bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets businesses and left it at that  watson mentions that dyn would not have gotten involved with enron had they not been approached by 'enron's top three executives'  who said that they thought a combination with dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies  says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with dyn to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger  watson doty said that they're not      sure that no surprises remain in enron's books--but that the risk reward offered by the combination was compelling  the deal does have material-adverse-change outs for dynegy  covering any mac regarding enron's assets or businesses  dynegy's lawyers indicated that the mac language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case  so dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the enron's total legal liability  from any source or cause of action  tops MONEY prior to closing  mcmahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements  but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements  ene international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list  the merger structure calls for a new entity to take over enron  enron is planning to hold an enron-specific conference call in the next few days  tentatively scheduled for DATE  initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities  mcmahon acknowledges that enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end  had the merger not materialized  dynegy's earnings guidance places enron-related earnings accretion at MONEY    -      which represents a '    haircut' to enron internal estimates  doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies  doty says that both enron and dynegy's books  as far as he understands  are relatively short-term in weight  and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity  says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash  chevrontexaco's investment in dynegy was calculated at a    discount to public prices on the date of negotiation  not disclosed   given the runup in dynegy stock last week  chevrontexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices  chevrontexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'   no further clarification given   whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the enron traders and marketers  they're used to being part of a winning team  and the combined entity will definitely be a winner  they have talked with most of the enron business leaders  and they are 'very excited' by the combination  they will be working with the enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained  whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions  he says that 'to the extent necessary  yes ' watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of dyn and ene--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus  but by the same token the new dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the dynegy of today  watson says that if there were to be any change in culture  he's a strong team player  he does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well  give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments

14.0	ken i know it has been several years since we spoke  but i wanted to thank you   for your kind note  and to personally thank you for the opportunities that   enron has provided to me over the years  i am one of those few who was already with hng in       and still vividly r  emember the day that you arrived  the building was immediately permeated b  y a sense of urgency and excitement  that pace was relentless - and addict  ive  i also remember in detail the internorth merger in       and feel pro  ud to have played a part  however small it was  in that transaction  the late     's and the early     's will probably always be my favorite ye  ars of my working life  there were so many initiatives in enron in their i  nfancy  although it was an initiative that faced insurmountable economics   and ultimately failed  i am grateful that enron gave me the opportunity to   participate in the natural gas vehicle adventure  i never really understoo  d until that adventure the full meaning of the old axiom that the lessons l  earnt best are those learnt from adversity and from making mistakes   i will try to remember enron with those years through the mid-    's in min  d  i have to say that i consider those to be the best years  because i hav  e witnessed a degradation of the corporate culture in the past few years    that is clearly a subjective assessment  and should be treated as such  i   am under no illusions  enron is a business entity operating in markets and  environments that are relentlessly competitive  with a primary responsibil  ity to its shareholders  but i and many of my colleagues who also have lon  g tenure at enron and its predecessors share this assessment  i am always   amused by the irony of the stated value "ruthlessness  callousness and arro  gance do not belong here"  since these appear to be the key defining person  al characteristics of most of the senior management of ena in recent years  and unfortunately  the very sale of hpl by enron has been for some an examp  le of the degradation of corporate culture  for myself  i know what to exp  ect - i know that with corporate divestitures comes the need to control inf  ormation as the transaction evolves  but for the "rank and file" - those w  ho live from paycheck to paycheck - it has not been a pleasant experience    they maintained their professionalism  indeed many of them probably worked  harder than anybody else to make the transaction happen   in return  ther  e has been an appalling lack of timely information and misinformation from   enron management and hr department with respect to their benefits and caree  r choices  hr in particular has been totally non-responsive to individual   inquiries in the past few months - not returning phone calls and emails fro  m hpl employees with questions  even after the transaction was announced    even as recently as the past couple of days  only upon receipt of their ter  mination packages did several dozen employees discover that they had been m  isinformed by hr with respect to some aspects of their remaining enron bene  fits  for myself  my years at enron will remain a high point of my career  it is  a badge of honor in the energy industry to have been a dealmaker at enron   particularly for as many years as i was there  i know enron will continue  to set the standards by most measures in this industry  and  for what its   worth  i humbly wish you continued success

6.0	in addition to the follow-up e-mail from the offsite  i want to explore the possibility that when you click the auction tab on enrononline you get dealbench functionality  i know this was explored once before but i want to explore the possibility that we have a single backbone with enrononline and customers have a single login to enron's services  including auctions  data rooms  and deal rooms  your thoughts  gp
6.0	my thoughts --    focus more on tariff standardization  i think that this is the key issue for enron because lmp based bid balancing market is almost a done deal - and the texas market seems to be fine for liquidity   build around a new proforma with a network plus model     i would highlight that size matters - re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments     i would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source sink requirement     the gas   power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration  ie  cng  but because of the geographic reach  many ldcs used columbia p l  but only one ldc uses aeps  the electric market needs transmission to be "rationalized" across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at     should we attack the     boards  agree that they are unnecessary  but pls be careful  thanks  jim

5.0	attached is the second draft of enron's comments to ferc on icap  the structure of the paper is summarised below     rto's are a positive step forward for the industry     spot markets are a necessary part of rto development to ensure that the rto can manage real time realiability     a well functioning spot market eliminates the need for separate capacity type products such as icap  reserve margin  i e  it achieves the objectives of icap   the paper incorporates theoretical and emperical evidence from other sectors of the economy and deregulation in other parts of the world to support this conclusion     during the transition from a regulated environment to rto's there may be a 'political' need for icap  specifically states that any interim proposal should be limited to   years after rto implementation     if that is the case  the paper sets out the two common theoretical platforms which can be used as a basis for icap     proposes two options based on the theroetical platforms  we would appreciate input on two issues  firstly  enron needs to make a decision on whether to limit our position to reliance on spot markets  i e  don't suggest an interim solution   while this is attractive  it is unlikely that enron will get support from other participants  icap payments subsidize generation investment so no support from ipp's and consumers are not as confident as enron that competitive markets will maintain reliability so they will want to sustain icap   secondly  drafting comments on the paper generally  please note that the final section  that proposes the enron solution  requires substantial redrafting which will be done if the consensus is to propose such a solution  a final draft will be sent out on the TIME of DATE        the paper will be filed DATE

6.0	i agree with lindy  i don't believe we want to mention anything about "shipper imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this  in instances where socalgas happens to issue an operational flow order  "ofo"  during the intraday   cycle  it can create imbalances with transwesterns customers  because it does not afford transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties  when an ofo is issued in the intraday   cycle  an allocation is passed on to transwestern through the confirmation process with socalgas  due to the timing of these ofo's  transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with transwestern's upstream parties  if you have further questions  please give me a call  thank you  terry kowalke
14.0	today  we announced plans to merge with dynegy  a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties  dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own  we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build  following are the major components of the transaction  deal terms -- the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of        dynegy shares for every enron share  for example  each       shares of enron stock will be converted to     shares of dynegy upon closing  plus cash for fractional shares  upon closing  -- chevrontexaco owns approximately    percent of dynegy's outstanding common stock  chevrontexaco will invest MONEY in dynegy immediately and an additional MONEY in dynegy on closing of the merger  dynegy will immediately invest MONEY in cash in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas  -- total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately     million shares  -- the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  and is expected to close late next year  enron will have immediate access to dynegy's MONEY cash investment in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary  management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company  which will be called dynegy inc   and steve bergstrom will be president and coo  i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes  i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman  greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes  then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman  mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron  management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth  efficient integration  the make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined  the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the DATE       this merger will create an enormous growth engine  providing great opportunities for our employees  shareholders and customers  as with any merger  some elimination of positions is almost inevitable  and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company  we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions  clearly  we cannot rule out involuntary separation  but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations  i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible  as i said in my video  this is a day like no other in our company's history  we considered several options  but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence  strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses  i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps  we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at  http   home enron com updates    if you have additional questions  please submit them to questions enron com  mailto questions enron com   we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions  if you receive any calls from the media  please refer them to our media team at          -      i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company  rather than closing doors  we are opening new ones  as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise  including our market reach  financial strength and industry experience  together  we will be a new merchant powerhouse  and again  thank you for everything you have done for enron  investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available  because it will contain important information  investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement prospectus  when it is available  and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron  without charge  at the sec's web site at www sec gov  copies of the joint proxy statement prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either  investor relations  dynegy inc        louisiana  suite       houston  tx        phone           -

5.0	john  i found the error  it was a small logic error  you can easily fix the problem if you go into the visual basic editor for the blotter file  in the editor  you will see several modules listed on the left of the screen under the file  you will need to edit the "main query" module  once in the "main query" module  you will need to search for the routine named "verifymanualinputs"  the actual start of the routine looks like this  function verifymanualinputs fromdate as string  todate as string  putcall as string  lots as string  strike as string  price as string  cparty as string  stype as string  as boolean within this routine  about   -   lines down  you should see the following two lines   if  isdate fromdate  and isdate todate   then if  todate   fromdate  then you need to change the second line to   if  cdate todate    cdate fromdate   then this should fix the problem  the intent of the line is to prevent the "to date" of a deal from being earlier than the "from date"  in the original line of code  it does a text based compare  like comparing is "abc"   "def"  instead of comparing the two values as dates  the modification i've laid out converts the from and to dates to date values before comparing  i have tested the fix here and it should work fine  i hope everything runs smooth for you next week  have a good thanksgiving  greg

6.0	as i mentioned in my previous e-mail  on DATE    dynegy filed a complaint against comed  this proceeding may be of particular interest to enron given ees's plans to offer physical delivery in illinois in early       i've outlined dynegy's principal arguments below  dynegy requested fast-track processing  so any intervention and comments we file are due DATE  oct      in order to file a timely intervention  and meaningful comments  if we decide to comment   i need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible  elizabeth and harlan  i'm copying you because i would especially like to know what you think of dynegy's characterization of the firm ld product  main argument  dynegy challenges comed's published business practice that allows "marketer firm"  firm ld  contracts to be designated as network resources  dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the oatt provisions that    network resources are generation "owned  purchased or leased by the network customer designated to serve network load " and    a network customer "must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract" in order to designate a network resource  dynegy's theory on why firm ld should not be a network resource  - permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others  creating reliability problems - firm ld under the eei contract is not capacity-backed  nor is it a commitment to purchase generation - allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity - since retail providers are allowed to rely on "over-the-counter" firm instead of securing long-term contracts  adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load dynegy claims that comed's practice has deprived dmg of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources  it cites specific instances in which comed has accepted transmission reservation requests from new energy and cilco in which these parties designated illinois power as a network resource  when only a firm ld contracts were in place with ip

6.0	as discussed  what happens to my wages salary if the company files for bankruptcy protection  the general rule is that a company that has filed a banruptcy petition is not able to make payments on any prepetition debts until a plan of reorganization is filed  however  there are certain exceptions to the general rule  claims related to wages and salary earned within     days of a bankruptcy petition filing  called "prepetition wages and salaries"  receive a special priority for upt to MONEY the bankruptcy code  section     a      and are usually paid in full as part of the plan of reorganization  most companies that intend to continue operating while in bankruptcy recognize the need to keep employees working and the potential hardship that would occur of wages were not paid or delayed  as a result  most companies that file a bankruptcy petition  but which inetend to remain in business  seek the specific authority of the bankruptcy court to make payments on the priority wage claims immediately so that employees will experience little or no disruption in their wage salary payments while they continue working  usually this authority is sought at the same time or shortly after a bankruptcy petition is filed  for a company that derives a great deal of its value from its employees  making sure these payments are made in a timely manner is a high priority
