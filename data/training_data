14.0	as you know  enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron  we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing  even though enron has entered into this agreement  u s  and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other  in particular  to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets  their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed  therefore  for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement  in addition  all information  documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller  lance schuler  robert eickenroht  mark haedicke  rob walls or greg whalley of enron  it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained  to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement  then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals  if you have any questions concerning this notice  please contact lance schuler         -       robert eickenroht         -       mark haedicke         -      or rob walls         -       thank you for your help in this matter

6.0	ken  greg  mark - thank you for your leadership over the last several weeks and TIME  we appreciate it  following are some additional thoughts and some more detail on my comments from TIME  the leadership group in that room needs to feel the sense of responsibility to lead our businesses  everything we say   do - including all written  verbal and "body language" - are signals  we must communicate and lead all day  every day  as an organization  and as part of our culture  we lead with our chin - always have and probably always will  we are going to take our share of bumps and bruises  we have some great businesses here    and we are fortunate  we have grown the size and profitability of our core businesses substantially  and in a market where many companies have not been as successful  most of our wounds are self - inflicted  we can and should do a better job  i believe this leadership team needs to make an absolute commitment in the following areas  vision - define what we want this company to be in the next  -  years value - as part of building the world's leading company  my vote is that we dedicate our energy towards building long term  sustainable value  this is not about just creating value in the eyes of wall street - this is about creating real value  perhaps as defined by "after tax operating profit minus the real cost of capital"  market cap will follow this type of economic value creation  we need to measure it and incent people this way  teamwork - we are a leadership team  i don't feel as though everyone buys into that nor is it clear that everyone around that table feels a sense of responsibility to lead across the business  i would like to discuss how we improve as a team  many of our employees  at an average age of    years  have never been through  an economic downturn a global military conflict problems like the ones we are currently experiencing at enron we need big time leadership now    from all who are around that table clear demonstration of our leadership - in clear view of our employees  customers and shareholders people - we must make sure to retain and enhance the interest of the employees that add value to enron everyday  these people need to believe - with our actions - that we are absolutely focused on making sure they have an environment that is conducive to building and creating value over the short  medium and long term  the ball is in our court  we have to lead and be perceived as credible leaders  we've got to dig deep and get down the road - together  if you wish  i would be pleased to discuss this further  thank you again for your leadership

14.0	ken i know it has been several years since we spoke  but i wanted to thank you   for your kind note  and to personally thank you for the opportunities that   enron has provided to me over the years  i am one of those few who was already with hng in       and still vividly r  emember the day that you arrived  the building was immediately permeated b  y a sense of urgency and excitement  that pace was relentless - and addict  ive  i also remember in detail the internorth merger in       and feel pro  ud to have played a part  however small it was  in that transaction  the late     's and the early     's will probably always be my favorite ye  ars of my working life  there were so many initiatives in enron in their i  nfancy  although it was an initiative that faced insurmountable economics   and ultimately failed  i am grateful that enron gave me the opportunity to   participate in the natural gas vehicle adventure  i never really understoo  d until that adventure the full meaning of the old axiom that the lessons l  earnt best are those learnt from adversity and from making mistakes   i will try to remember enron with those years through the mid-    's in min  d  i have to say that i consider those to be the best years  because i hav  e witnessed a degradation of the corporate culture in the past few years    that is clearly a subjective assessment  and should be treated as such  i   am under no illusions  enron is a business entity operating in markets and  environments that are relentlessly competitive  with a primary responsibil  ity to its shareholders  but i and many of my colleagues who also have lon  g tenure at enron and its predecessors share this assessment  i am always   amused by the irony of the stated value "ruthlessness  callousness and arro  gance do not belong here"  since these appear to be the key defining person  al characteristics of most of the senior management of ena in recent years  and unfortunately  the very sale of hpl by enron has been for some an examp  le of the degradation of corporate culture  for myself  i know what to exp  ect - i know that with corporate divestitures comes the need to control inf  ormation as the transaction evolves  but for the "rank and file" - those w  ho live from paycheck to paycheck - it has not been a pleasant experience    they maintained their professionalism  indeed many of them probably worked  harder than anybody else to make the transaction happen   in return  ther  e has been an appalling lack of timely information and misinformation from   enron management and hr department with respect to their benefits and caree  r choices  hr in particular has been totally non-responsive to individual   inquiries in the past few months - not returning phone calls and emails fro  m hpl employees with questions  even after the transaction was announced    even as recently as the past couple of days  only upon receipt of their ter  mination packages did several dozen employees discover that they had been m  isinformed by hr with respect to some aspects of their remaining enron bene  fits  for myself  my years at enron will remain a high point of my career  it is  a badge of honor in the energy industry to have been a dealmaker at enron   particularly for as many years as i was there  i know enron will continue  to set the standards by most measures in this industry  and  for what its   worth  i humbly wish you continued success 
6.0	in addition to the follow-up e-mail from the offsite  i want to explore the possibility that when you click the auction tab on enrononline you get dealbench functionality  i know this was explored once before but i want to explore the possibility that we have a single backbone with enrononline and customers have a single login to enron's services  including auctions  data rooms  and deal rooms  your thoughts  gp
11.0	with ken lay's resignation  you undoubtedly have questions about enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company  the purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild  first  the creditors committee has proposed that the board of directors retain an interim ceo to focus on the restructuring process  this is a positive sign that the committee believes enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business  the enron board of directors has approved stephen cooper as interim ceo and chief restructuring officer  steve is the managing partner of zolfo cooper  a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than    years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations  steve and his firm will work with members of enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy  as you know  enron has entered into an agreement with ubs warburg for the sale of netco  enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization  in preparation for the transition of netco to ubs  greg whalley has resigned as president and coo of enron to assume a position with ubs warburg  we want to thank greg and the netco employees joining ubs for their contributions to enron and wish them great success going forward  in addition to engaging steve  enron has formed an office of the chief executive  i will join steve in that office as president and chief operating officer  and ray bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer  we will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined  thank you for continuing to support enron by performing your job everyday  the ongoing uncertainty about our future  coupled with the constant media scrutiny  makes this situation difficult for all of us  while no one can control the media  we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead  and in doing so  we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees  link to the press release  http   www enron com corp pressroom releases      ene       release html

14.0	today we announced the appointment of jeff mcmahon as enron's chief financial officer  in my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today  it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence  jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of enron  he is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us  andy fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company  jeff had been serving as chairman and ceo of enron industrial markets  he joined enron in      and spent three years in the london office as chief financial officer for enron's european operations  upon returning to the u s   jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for enron corp  in       he was named president and chief operating officer of enron net works  i know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price  i am too  and we are working very hard to turn it around  appointing jeff as cfo is one important step in that process  but most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence  the fundamentals of our business are strong  and i think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform  please join me in giving jeff your full support  and thank you for all of your continued hard work

14.0	as you know  enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron  we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing  even though enron has entered into this agreement  u s  and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other  in particular  to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets  their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed  therefore  for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement  in addition  all information  documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller  lance schuler  robert eickenroht  mark haedicke  rob walls or greg whalley of enron  it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained  to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement  then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals  if you have any questions concerning this notice  please contact lance schuler         -       robert eickenroht         -       mark haedicke         -      or rob walls         -       thank you for your help in this matter

14.0	jim and rob  i hope you are both well and was really pleased to see that last week's merger negotiations reached a successful outcome this must have required an incredible effort in the timescale and given everything else that is going on i very much hope this will allow you to enjoy a more stable period after the events of the last few weeks you both have many friends at linklaters and we are all pulling for you at this time  i also thought you may like to have a brief overview of the main areas in which we are assisting at the moment these are as follows   merger we are working with robert eickenroht on the uk european anti-trust aspects this kicked off with a conference call today greatly appreciate the instructions  jim   dabhol we are continuing our role on dabhol which is now primarily focused on the litigation side and a major commitment for a   partner team-chris walker is  i believe  in houston tomorrow to meet with bruce lundstrum and others input from the projects side continues  principally in relation to sch    ppa  but is not likely to be extensive over the next month or so given the current emphasis in india   enron europe we are in close contact with mark and have a number of ongoing   new matters in particular  we have a dedicated team advising europe on its position and contingency planning for current circumstances-this team has been liaising with mark haedicke and the weil gotchal team we are also assisting on some potential disposals in non core business areas our london secondee remains in place   other we have a number of ongoing matters ranging from sedco litigation through a bid for lng purchases from nigeria lng given the understandable emphasis on cost control at this time  it may be that we should review these matters to determine whether you feel it appropriate to scale back legal spend in some areas  on the question of payment we have invoices totalling more than    million outstanding and this level of commitment  of course  continues to grow in the light of our ongoing work as mentioned on DATE  we do need to reduce this to a more manageable level   we are currently speaking with mark and bruce  in particular  to find a way of achieving this  and your continuing support in this effort would be greatly appreciated  we really want to do all we can at both a personal and professional level  to support enron at this time-i am particularly conscious of the support and friendship you have given to me over the years if there is anything else we can do  please do call me at any time for convenience my nos  are  w                 m                h                best wishes stuart

6.0	elizabeth  background  on DATE     the npuc voted to authorize its general counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain spp np long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at ferc  according to the utilities  the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately MONEY  enclosed  you'll find         attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical enron-spp np deals that are     currently flowing or     scheduled for future delivery  i have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of spp np's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief  not refunds  i am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to spp and np  worst case  back of the envelope  we are looking at approximately MONEY in mtm exposure for all deals  however  the prices under these deals range from MONEY to MONEY  the MONEY is for transmission   it's extremely unlikely that ferc would     void every transaction or     reduce the price for every deal to MONEY  the true amount at risk is less than MONEY  bottom line  all in all  i think the risk of ferc undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons     the alj in the pacific northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because     the non-california long-term market was competitive  and     because of the concern about "ripple" claims  although the commission has not yet adopted the alj's recommendation  i expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support     spp np is the only party arguing that the southwest market is uncompetitive  this aspect was fatal to the pacific northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds     spp np was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the california utilities  which were required to buy from the px  presumably  these were the lowest prices available at the time     if ferc voids or reprices these contracts  it will be pressured to do the same for california's dwr contracts  contracts collateral  these transactions are all under the wspp  we currently hold no collateral from spp np  tracy ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the wspp did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event  such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase  i advised her that the wspp standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's "financial viability" decreases  my view is that spp np's admission that it is MONEY under water is  in itself  cause for a margin call  i am  however  sensitive to the fact that a margin call might     be perceived as "punishing" spp np for "trying to enforce the law " or     strengthen spp np's resolve to seek refunds  tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this  mitigation  i spoke with tim belden and tracy ngo about this on DATE the   th  there is zero interest in trying to work with spp np on a blend extend  "why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money " there is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at ferc  ultimately  we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure  other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at ferc and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at ferc

14.0	yesterday  enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas  our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline  dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron's right to repurchase until DATE     we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy  while we would like to keep northern natural  we still have some       miles of safe  profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses  the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our MONEY damage claim against dynegy  it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts  we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas  below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services  ken dear ets colleague  on DATE  enron entered into a settlement over dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline  the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy  in this respect  enron corp  has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas  consequently  enron corp  has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy  while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved  the company has concluded that with this settlement  enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly  as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court  for the northern natural gas employees  i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable  successful business  beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe  reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas  over many years we have run high quality  cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets  keep up the good work  stan

11.0	i know that this is a difficult time for all of us  with everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us  we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year  to be honest  employee feedback has been mixed  many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as enron employees to share the spirit of the season  others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances  after weighing these points of view  we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-enron holiday party that was scheduled for DATE    given what has transpired over the past month  it could be considered imprudent for enron to incur the expense of such an event  i regret that this action is necessary because i recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more  we will attempt to find other  more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season

11.0	during the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we  are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor buil  d out given the state of the company today  we appreciate people's concern  s about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be redu  cing unnecessary expenses  let us begin by saying that we share these conc  erns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditu  res without a great deal of thought  we would also encourage people to tal  k to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing  certain things  in short  we have decided to continue with the college re  cruiting  although we have not yet decided how many  if any  we will hire    we have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple  of weeks  why are we continuing with college recruiting  during the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a p  resence for enron broadly and the portland office specifically with leading  schools in the northwest  this past year we finally reached critical mass  and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts  although we are unc  ertain about our hiring needs this year  we feel that it is in our best lon  g term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the north  west  we have already made presentations and done initial screenings at mo  st schools  we have identified the best people from each school and have a  lready made plans for them to come to our office for two super saturdays    the cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit   that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as pa  rticipants in their on-campus recruiting programs  we also realize that it  is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job  it is our be  lief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities  of employment may be somewhat diminished  finally  we would like to empha  size the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody  we will i  nterview people  identify the best candidates  and make hiring decisions ba  sed on the needs of the office  before extending offers we will consider t  he potential impact that it could have on people in this office and enron e  mployees in other offices who have been redeployed  stated another way  we  don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within enro  n who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people alread  y here at risk  we may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are mor  e certain about the state of affairs in the company  how will the floor move play out  we have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks  while we   still think that it makes sense for the office  we have decided to pause fo  r a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money o  n this  when talking to the build out team today it became clear that dela  ying would accomplish several goals  first  it allows us to get final arch  itectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can mo  re precisely peg down the costs before moving forward  second  it gives th  e build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move    finally  it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes  sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right n  ow  while we still think that we are going to move forward with this proje  ct  it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do  right now  in about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team w  ith firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead  cancel  o  r delay again      as always  we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new  rel  iable information becomes available  we recognize that this is a very hard  time for everyone  please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep  up the success of this office

7.0	ken-- for what it's worth  here's a little perspective from some distance  a MONEY here  a billion there  it's adding up to serious numbers  but even worse is the loss of what was once  not long ago  a great stock of trust and credibility  both for enron and ken lay personally  DATE's ny times front page of the business section story is about as bad as it gets  short of suspicions of personal dishonesty or criminal culpability  suspicion or innuendo that maybe you didn't fully understand the deals must hurt as bad as any of the barbs  the old dumb-but-honest defense is not something you want to use in this case  anyway  and i doubt you could convince many people you didn't understand it  the analogy of clinton   nixon in their darkest hours comes to mind  nixon's "i am not a crook" speech or clinton's "i did not have sex with that woman" did not fix their problems  when things get this bad the best  maybe only  way to re-coup is get really candid and lay all the cards on the table face up  with one important caveat about which more later   humility  contrition   candor are the antidotes for hubris  arrogance   deviousness  whether they were real or just perceived  in whatever the right venue is  and i'm unsure on that  i'd like to see you tell the world  this is what we did  this is why we did it  this is why we were confident it was wholly proper  this is why it didn't come out as well as we had hoped  this what we believe it might cost us when all is said   done  and i will answer any questions you have on any of this because we have to get it behind us and get on with running an ongoing business  with the press on your case  and the sec  and enron's high bush-related profile  and its critical position in the markets  and the tantalizing non-coincidence of jeff's recent sudden departure -- this is a story that has legs  it's going to sell newspapers  fuel gossip and energize competitors until the fire's out and the smoke has dissipated  national tv coverage is a possibility even  but for anthrax and osama-gate  for you to try to spoon-feed the pack on your heels will just make the story last longer and get juicer  only a pre-emptive total disclosure can quench it even half as quickly as you'd hope for  but the caveat  if anybody is exposed to personal criminal liability  then it ain't nearly so simple  in those circumstances  the best attorney you can get will have to counsel every move  and both the person and the corporation would need their own separate lawyers because interests can diverge very fast  i don't think for a minute that this is a real issue  but i didn't think i'd see a $   stock price either  the enormity of this quake has shaken even those who only wish you the best  imagine how good it makes the hyenas feel  as i said before  lots of luck  buddy  you need it worse that i ever thought you would  kindest regards to linda  too  ross

9.0	dear mr lay  i write to you as chairman and chief executive officer of the enron corporation because i would like you to know that i am on my second period of sick leave in a year due to work related stress  a year ago i was apologised to by the human resources department and told that they would not allow it to happen again  through constant pressure and the unfair way in which i have been treated  the advice of my doctor and counsellor  as they are concerned with my health  was to accept the voluntary redundancy which had been offered to my colleagues and myself recently  though due to my exceptional circumstances i wrote the attached letter  today i received the attached response and i feel totally devastated that enron europe will not compensate me fairly for how they have affected my life and that of my family's  i read in enron's literature that you care about your employees and their families  and feel that your code of ethics should have offered me protection against the circumstances that i find myself in  but to my complete and utter dismay i find this is not the case and in my experience i have suffered a great deal and this seems to have been totally ignored in the response letter  i haven't once been contacted by enron europe to see how i'm coping and give me any support whatsoever  they are showing no care or concern for me or my family  i write to you for help in this matter and to conclude this stressful situation that i find myself in due to your company  under the circumstances and increased stress that the response letter has put upon me  i would be most grateful if you would respond to me as soon as possible

directors  issuing false and misleading reports and other off  enses     deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in en  ron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself   give dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force enron to renegotiate it  s terms  instead  they say  dynegy would likely have to prove that enron's   worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event  which could be di  fficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and dynegy's f  requent statement that it clearly understands enron's businesses  still  th  ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow dyne  gy to terminate the deal if "any representation or warranty of enron shall   have become untrue "

doesn't have new ru  les     the slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden   changes in the market  the most recent failure followed the terrorist attac  ks on september     an fasb task force  unable to come up with a set of rul  es for separating september    costs from general expenses  instead told co  mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item  so  gaap earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan  y's general performance  many companies have nevertheless broken those cost  s out in their unaudited press releases     many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter  indeed       is shapin  g up to be one for the record books  a poor economy and the devastating aft  ereffects of september    have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a  re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen  but there's a gro  wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide  missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char  ges  the temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now  while   investors are braced for bad news  not only can managers sweep away yesterd  ay's errors  but tomorrow's earnings will look even better     the basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char  ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di  stort the truth about a company's performance  usually  big charges DATE in  to a few categories  including charges for laying

are some excerpts from the interview     in the wake of the sept     attacks  how much more risk  if any  do you thi  nk is in the financial markets  or do you think it's just that people's per  ceptions about risk have changed     i've been investing since       and i have to say that  year after year  th  e risk hasn't changed  the risk is always there  there's risk in investing   in stocks  bonds and even u s  treasuries because of interest-rate  fluctua  tions   there's risk in real estate  too     so the question is  how do you handle it  the best way is to diversify  ove  r a long

and so forth  there's just too much uncertainty in   the markets     i remember back during the cuban missile crisis  we all feared the worst  w  e were all building bomb shelters  it was a scary time

 before the economy goes up     there's MONEY  trillion sitting in money-market accounts  that's a huge resourc  e and buying power that's definitely available for new investments     what do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past   two or so months     they let their emotions take over  with the fear that people had  they didn  't use their rational thinking  they used their emotional thinking   after   sept       they sold at the low  and fear was the driver     just a year and a half ago  the driving emotion was greed  you're not going  to avoid this stuff  so the issue is how you manage through these cycles o  f fear and greed  even when i'm fearful of something  i say to myself  "thi  s is still the time to invest "    my biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say  "i just don  't want to be in the stock market at all " and it's just the time that peop  le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio     some other

management  it put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and ha  d very strong management " james lam  founder of erisk  a consulting firm       as an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man  agement of price risks  i have been an admirer of enron's elaborate disclos  ure of its risk management practices  and yet  in a cascade of events over   a period of just three weeks from mid-october  it lost two-thirds of its sh  are value  became the subject of a us securities exchange commission  sec    investigation  and was taken over by a rival a third in size   latest repor  ts create some doubt about whether this will go through   what went wrong  no  the events had nothing to do with dabhol  indeed  if  for us in india    enron will always be associated with the controversial power project  elsew  here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting  finance a  nd general management   on second thoughts  even its indian adventures woul  d make an excellent case study      but first  a recount of what happened  after announcing on october     with  out much explanation or transparency  that it has taken a charge of MONEY     b  illion against equity  enron's share price started tumbling  apparently  th  e charge was the result of some financial transactions  and the sec launche  d an investigation  the chief financial officer  cfo   who was directly inv  olved with the transactions  the company's treasurer and a couple of other   senior officials were sacked     perhaps most damagingly  enron revised its accounts from      onwards  redu  cing profits by about MONEY     million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil  ar amount  as a result  enron's credit rating was downgraded     it seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr  ading  but in its investment activities controlled by the cfo  these compri  sed private equity  and enron's share in each of the investee companies was  kept artificially below    per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts  to  this end  outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in enron  itself  should the value of the investee company ies  DATE below agreed th  reshold s      all this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet  and   mitigate their impact on reported profits  many other us corporations inclu  ding j p morgan chase  which had large private equity investments  have suf  fered on this score  see world money october      enron wanted to avoid thi  s and  last year  paid its since-dismissed cfo MONEY for his creativ  e accounting genius     incidentally  those enamoured of us gaap and its alleged superiority over t  he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th  e company's auditors one of the big five firms  which was paid MONEY  as audit fees and MONEY for other services by enron last year     the restatement of the accounts from      onwards became necessary as the e  nron management board and the auditors were forced  on review  to admit tha  t at least some of the transactions should have been on  rather than off  b  alance sheet  details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o  ut  but what has come out is bad enough     but this apart  a billion dollar hit for a company of the size  MONEY     billi  on  or cash flow  MONEY  of enron is  by itself  hardly a death warra  nt  but it turned out to be just that for enron     perhaps because it was too arrogant  perhaps also because its accounts lack  ed transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was  always somewhat fragile     but there are two other points worth noting  the professionalism of equity   analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin  g and producing  as for the first  the professional analysts were surely aw  are of the opaqueness of the accounts but few questioned the management agg  ressively on the subject  perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified   the spirit of the times trading assets was what the "masters of the univers  e" did  not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars  the   enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a  ctivity of trading in power and gas  with skilling  the former ceo  claming  that "we are on the side of angels  we are taking on the entrenched monopo  lies  we are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world   "  the quotation is from an interview in businessweek  prior to skilling's   inglorious exit from enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst      for the analysts  there was also safety in numbers  skilling claimed that "  enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec  hnologies and physical technologies"  bringing derivatives theory to tradin  g in power and gas  obviously  the fate of long term capital management has  not led to more sober management of trading risks     surely the role of "markets" should be to reduce the distance  and cost  be  tween producer and consumer  one does feel that there is something perverse  in a society that values  in terms of compensation  the trader  don't forg  et this is just a euphemism for the speculator  over the producer whether i  n the bond  currency or power and gas markets  the markets and  indeed  gre  ed obviously have a role to play  but surely the pendulum needs to swing a   little bit to the left  copyright        dow jones

5.0	this is an alert that ferc will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals  the orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that tennessee  anr and columbia had done  these provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates  but ferc has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative  thus  anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny  ferc adds another layer to policy on negotiated-rate authority acting on a series of contract-specific cases  ferc last week sharpened its policy on what is  and is not  allowed under negotiated rates  in further defining its policy  the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates  during discussion of the orders  chairman pat wood iii said it was "important to keep in mind  as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side " that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines " last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend " he asserted  in representative language  the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment  ferc declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers  in cases involving rates negotiated by anr pipeline co   gt  -    rp  -      tennessee gas pipeline co   rp  -     et al   and columbia gas transmission corp   cp  -     the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs  the provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals  while the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package  "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates  it said in the tennessee order  where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity  recourse service provides an "adequate alternative " the commission observed  "however  if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff  the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute  since recourse service would not include any such provision " a shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk  giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers " the commission pointed out  "a shipper's right to reduce  or terminate  its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right  since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges " ferc said  adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner " requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated" in a fair manner  ferc reasoned  once approved  the tariff language "will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers " commissioner linda breathitt applauded the policy shift  characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become "muddled " through a "tortured line of cases " ferc's definitions of allowable contracting practices were "obscured " breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense" approach  the "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers  she said

6.0	by telefax of DATE     uriel dutton of f j provided a proposed waiver letter agreement for our review  i will have copies of that proposed agreement circulated by hand-delivery and fax to all those on this list and to mariner's gc  at present  i am not sending this e-mail to mariner's gc  if there is someone else i need to send this e-mail to  please let me know  chuck and i have reviewed the letter  believe it to be overly broad  and hope that f j is willing to negotiate further  along the following lines     on page    third full paragraph  second line  we suggest inserting "enron corp  and " between "representation of" and "enron's affiliates"     on page    paragraph      we are concerned about the third sentence  which reads as follows  "enron corp  agrees that it will cause each existing or future affiliate of enron corp  to comply with the agreements of the enron entities herein set forth " we think  although we do not know for sure  that f j's concern is that f j may become adverse in the future to some existing enron entity that f j does not currently represent  or that does not currently exist  and that either of these two entities may seek to assert disqualification based on f j's current representation of enron entities  if this is the reason for the sentence  we don't see how an existing enron entity or future enron entity could assert a conflict that has been waived by the enron entity that is actually being represented  we also have a concern about asking enron corp  to cause all of its "affiliates"  as defined in the letter agreement  to comply with it  enron corp  may not have the power to require all its "affiliates" to comply  our suggestion would be that this letter agreement be signed on behalf of all the actual enron entities currently represented by f j  including mariner     on page       lines from the top  we find objectionable the language that begins  "without limiting the foregoing   " it seems to us that here  f j wants all the enron companies to be considered separately for disqualification purposes  and perhaps to be able to sue one enron entity even though f j is representing another enron entity in a substantially related matter     on pages  -   paragraph      we have a concern about the third sentence  which reads as follows  "if dynegy declines or fails to do so promptly after receipt of our request  it is expressly agreed and understood that f j shall be entitled   " our concern is that we are committing enron entities to an agreed course of action post-merger based on speculation as to what dynegy may or may not do  our suggestion would be that we simply ask f j to delete all but the first two sentences of paragraph         please note that under the terms of this proposed agreement  we are not requiring f j to be liable for the ramp-up costs of new counsel for  e g   the licensing project or the asbestosis cases  in the event that enron corp  cannot be dismissed from the asbestosis cases pre-trial   we do not believe that ramp-up costs will be something f j will agree to if we need f j to take on the new mariner matter  mariner's gc called me today to advise that it was urgent that she know today or tomorrow whether f j was going to be able to represent mariner on a new  critical asset-sale matter that is scheduled to close no later than DATE     otherwise  she will need to hire other counsel to handle that matter  please let us have your comments as soon as possible  britt

19.0	all  i am pleased to report that we have resolved the infamous james river contract with bpa under favorable terms  the signed agreements are on my desk right now  besides significantly reducing our litigation risk  the addition of     mw h and the change of delivery point have added MONEY to the value of the contract  bpa and epmi have amended the original contract to specify that  i  bpa will deliver     mw h      for the  -year term of the agreement  an increase of     mw h over the original    ii  the disputed "alternative delivery point" is designated as mid-c   iii  all language to the contrary is deleted from the agreement   iv  the parties agree to "book out" the james river physical deliveries against epmi sales to bpa at the mid-c delivery point  so no power will flow   and  v  we will continue to invoice bpa each month for the term of the agreement  just as if the power was still flowing  although my preference would have been to terminate the james river agreement  bpa refused to do so because it would not have been able to recover the costs of this contract in its rates  similarly  i had hoped that we could do a one-time book-out  but bpa refused to do so because--according to bpa's finance person---such a book-out would have converted this to a financial deal requiring bpa to use mark-to-market accounting  therefore  we executed two documents  one amending the original contract  and another called the "book-out agreement " which sets out an agreement to book-out specific transactions over the next five years  i am satisfied that this is a favorable deal for epmi because     we resolve the disputes over quantity and delivery point  which     will make it very difficult for bpa to change its mind in the future and argue that we are not entitled to receive power unless we are selling it to james river  and     the negotiated increase in quantity and change in delivery point add over MONEY in value to the contract  thanks to everyone for your help 
6.0	mark just a quick question while i remember  as you know i am giving an overview of the dash process and the legal risk memo that must accompany any dash  my understanding is that the legal risk memo must be attached to the dash when the dash is circulated and that on the face of the dash form prepared by rac  we should not be and there should not appear any legal risk assessment  which must only be contained in the legal risk memo  the dash should simply refer to "see attached legal risk memo"  i am hoping that this is also how you like to see the process work in practice  in addition i am going to say that if possible you need to be briefed and receive a draft of the legal risk memo before it is circulated with the dash  see you shortly  marcus
6.0	i agree with lindy  i don't believe we want to mention anything about "shipper imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this  in instances where socalgas happens to issue an operational flow order  "ofo"  during the intraday   cycle  it can create imbalances with transwesterns customers  because it does not afford transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties  when an ofo is issued in the intraday   cycle  an allocation is passed on to transwestern through the confirmation process with socalgas  due to the timing of these ofo's  transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with transwestern's upstream parties  if you have further questions  please give me a call  thank you

6.0	after giving this trade situation way too much thought  i have arrived at the following conclusions  giving examples along the way so blockheads like defoggi can understand the concepts       one suggestion is to have the online trading system allow first come  first serve between specified hours days as allotted by the website  unfortunately  the reality is that this won't work because there are available free agents on my team and the only way to add drop is that i become notified anyway and go in and manually do the transaction and waive the fee      power ratings so that the low man on the totem pole gets a chance for first pick  okay  so a trader makes a bad trade  loses money  gets fired  and then gets the same job trading elsewhere for more money  a loser is a loser and should be acknowledged as such  see feeley   those are the breaks in this game  besides  too time consuming for me to go through the numbers      free market    first come  first served  anytime  anywhere  this is a good concept in that those that dedicate the time to watching  studying  and anticipating an opportunity are allowed to seize the moment and get paid  and they should because it is just like a small business  you get out of it what you put into it  time is money  however  you can't do add drops once your lineup is set and you should only be able to apply trades to the upcoming week anyways      calling two fellow team owners to validate your trade  really  would you trust gibby in this situation  i can hear it now  "oh yeah  dude  i was drinking a soder pop when he called but he neva said anything about picking up that qb " so  i have reached what i call a fair and amicable solution to all of your f cked up problems  first  the core of someone's team is going to decide the results week in and week out  i've been in this long enough to know that pickups  especially in a big league  are rarely gonna make that big of a difference in the outcome of a season  past examples include wr thrash who had a spectacular game against seattle only to turn around and have a dismal game against the lowly cowboys  there was MONEY to the pot  what i am getting at is that i think trading is way overrated and only serves to build the pot for the team that drafted the strongest in the beginning anyways  second  online access allows a level playing field  i agree with this and it should be implemented because it is also time stamped so there is no question as to who was first in a selection  if an owner is going to stoop so low as to change the clock on their computer to try and get an earlier time stamp  then there are bigger mental problems down the road and the money you make off the win should be applied accordingly  third  my time is just as important and so is a "transaction" period  for example  this DATE is octoberfest DATE in fredericksburg  if you think i am going to hang around and stay sober so i can meet your demands and implement your requests  you are sorely mistaken  i fully expect to start drinking myself into oblivion DATE TIME and don't expect to come out of my coma until sometime DATE TIME so your changes requests questions need to be done by DATE TIME  so  here is what i suggest      to make an add drop  trade  transaction  click on the "owners" tab on the league homepage  found up top next to live chat   page down to the bottom of the page and send a broadcast email to all team members announcing your intentions  i will implement the trade s  on the DATE following the DATE TIME game  the transaction deadline is DATE      pm for the DATE games  if i receive the email timestamped before then  i will make the trade for the upcoming DATE  if there is a DATE TIME game  DATE      pm is the deadline for the DATE  at any time after the deadline if a transaction is submitted  it will apply to the following DATE  also  there will be no limit on the amount of transactions  feel free to contribute as much as you wish      regarding current requested trades for the past DATE  for this week only  send me an email with your request  i will take one trade per team this week only  if two teams want the same free agent  whoever guesses closes to where the nasdaq composite closes DATE  rd wins  the loser will be notified as such  so  be sure to include your guess  this should provide everyone easy online access to making trades  all you have to do is make sure the free agent is indeed free  that nobody has already sent you an email picking him up  and shoot a broadcast out to the owners proclaiming him as yours  simple  so  any questions or concerns can be sent back to discuss  i will shoot down all of them  i am going to lunch  i eagerly await the opportunity to tell you why your plan won't work 
6.0	john  further to the voice message that i left you  i have recalculated the amount of security that would be required if all of the modified direct sales contracts are acknowledged by noon DATE    the calculations are still a bit rough but i thought this spreadsheet would provide you with something to review  i have used a $   pool price in the calculations  note the additional tabs in the spreadsheet that detail the hourly generation that the pool has received for sd  and sd    in determining the actual security required  we will need to review the megawatts in the contracts registered in detail once we have the acknowledgements tomorrow  for simplicity i have assumed that everything is base load and i know this is not correct  once we know exactly what contracts we are looking at  we can fine tune the calculation 
21.0	ken and jeff  glen darden  the president and ceo of quicksilver resources  inc   is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine  recently  he has asked whether i would consider serving as an outside director on the board of directors of quicksilver  before meeting with glen to discuss this further  i want to make sure that enron does not have any objections  headquartered in fort worth  texas  quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties  quicksilver began trading publicly in march of      on the american stock exchange  kwk   quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with enron  enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today  enron  via jedi  also provided some financing at the time of the merger of quicksilver and mercury exploration and was a significant shareholder of quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering  i believe jedi has since divested this stockholding  if i were to serve on the board of quicksilver  i expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which i would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board  however  i do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as quicksilver's core business is complementary to enron  not competitive with enron  as a personal matter  it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry  i am scheduled to meet with glen and others at quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility  would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position  please do not hesitate to call me  x       if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further  thanks  jim hughes

5.0	this is an alert that ferc will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals  the orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that tennessee  anr and columbia had done  these provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates  but ferc has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative  thus  anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny  ferc adds another layer to policy on negotiated-rate authority acting on a series of contract-specific cases  ferc last week sharpened its policy on what is  and is not  allowed under negotiated rates  in further defining its policy  the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates  during discussion of the orders  chairman pat wood iii said it was "important to keep in mind  as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side " that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines " last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend " he asserted  in representative language  the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment  ferc declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers  in cases involving rates negotiated by anr pipeline co   gt  -    rp  -      tennessee gas pipeline co   rp  -     et al   and columbia gas transmission corp   cp  -     the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs  the provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals  while the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package  "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates  it said in the tennessee order  where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity  recourse service provides an "adequate alternative " the commission observed  "however  if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff  the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute  since recourse service would not include any such provision " a shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk  giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers " the commission pointed out  "a shipper's right to reduce  or terminate  its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right  since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges " ferc said  adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner " requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated" in a fair manner  ferc reasoned  once approved  the tariff language "will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers " commissioner linda breathitt applauded the policy shift  characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become "muddled " through a "tortured line of cases " ferc's definitions of allowable contracting practices were "obscured " breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense" approach  the "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers  she said

investors don't trust enron by michael rapoport            dow jones news service  copyright  c        dow jones   company  inc   a dow jones newswires column new york - dow jones - if you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust enron corp   ene   here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock  enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value  it fell below that milestone weeks ago  no  now it trades for less than one-third of its book value  that's a rare level for a company of enron's size and prominence  and it may mean  among other things  that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures  much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly  first  let's be clear about what this means  enron stock is currently about MONEY  a share  the company's reported book value is about MONEY      a share  in other words  enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash  pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders  this is an uncommonly dismal level for any company  even a troubled one  for comparison's sake  dynegy inc   dyn   which has agreed to buy enron  trades at about three times book value  as does el paso corp   epg   a competitor of both companies  in fact  enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the standard   poor's    -stock index - only conseco inc   cnc   another troubled company  is lower  by an eyelash  part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that dynegy's agreement to buy enron will fall apart  and the belief that enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does  in which case enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value  the dynegy deal now amounts to about MONEY      per enron share  itself well under enron's book value  the huge premium that level offers over enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form  but given enron's current woes  it's certainly also possible that enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of enron  those numbers  after all  are the raw material that form the basis for valuing enron  or any other company  by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios  and the enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers  with enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted  in terms of those numbers  the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by MONEY    billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships  when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of MONEY    million  and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a MONEY    million note   that deadline has now been extended until dec       when you've gotten punched in the face three times  it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow  no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be  given enron's insanely complicated structure  and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks  who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come  that's what investors appear to be fearing  and that may be part of the reason enron stock has fallen so precipitously  thanks to enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on  investors no longer have a firm  trustworthy basis on which to value the stock  and so  not surprisingly  the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative  bare-minimum level  an enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment  it's ironic  in a way  for a long time  it was hard to properly value enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher  now it's hard to properly value enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy  -by michael

to MONEY  billion of additional financing  said enron spokeswoman karen denne  the company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-DATE  she said  but investors appear to be voting with their feet  enron shares were recently down        or    cents  to MONEY      while dynegy shares slipped       or MONEY      to MONEY       as a result  the already huge discount to the deal's offer price

due nov      but investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company  citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions  that means more institutional investors left holding the bag if enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by dynegy inc   dyn   over the last few years  citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of MONEY      billion in enron exposure  citigroup was instrumental in setting up enron credit linked notes trust  enron credit linked notes trust ii and yosemite securities trust i  which together raised MONEY      billion  enron sterling credit linked notes trust and yosemite securities co   which raised a combined gbp    million  and enron euro credit linked notes trust  which issued eur    million  citigroup  which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts  receives the return on the portfolio of single-a-plus-or-better-rated securities  purchased with the proceeds of the offerings  in exchange for providing the payout on the enron exposure  according to mary ryan  director of synthetic securities ratings at standard   poor's  as long as enron remains out of bankruptcy  citigroup continues to make payments on the notes  ryan said  if enron defaults  citigroup would cease making payments to the trust  the single-a-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default enron debt obligations  and with speculation mounting that dynegy will reduce  or maybe even scrap  its offer to buy enron  the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising  these notes essentially are synthetic enron debts  meaning they act like enron bonds in many respects  but lack key components that make holders true creditors of enron  for instance  the holders of these notes  because they don't possess actual enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt  it has been reported that enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors  the synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to enron's rating of triple-b-minus from standard   poor's and baa  from moody's investors service  the rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in enron's ratings

dow jones   company  inc   of dow jones newswires  this story was published originally friday  new york - dow jones - here's one      outlook that couldn't have been more wrong  around this time last year  pundits and fund managers were touting "the perfect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in       then came the california power crisis  and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group  that was followed by renewed volatility in power prices  and this time the prices were headed down  not up  and then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player  enron corp   ene   simply put  the perfect storm stalled  and a business once buoyed by high gas prices  strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters  the stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade  and the chance for recovery in       basu mullick  portfolio manager of the neuberger berman partners fund  is willing to bet there is  he thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median  which is currently between   - to   -times future earnings  he said  it's just a matter of time before the stocks get there  "they were just recovering from gray davis " mullick said  referring to the governor of california  who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state  and triggering the state's energy crisis  "now  they are recovering from enron " the fund manager also blames lower commodity prices  warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group  "energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates " he said  "i don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility " still  others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures  enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues  although many of enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues  there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create  answers elude investors investors are asking hard questions  and not always getting the answers they want  using mark-to-market methods  a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract  an option  a swap  etc  - at the time  even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period  the problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment  also  sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position  this is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid  over time  companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure  said abn amro inc  analyst paul patterson  encouragingly  it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure  according to a survey patterson conducted  more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during DATE conference calls compared with those in the second quarter  patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based  "all things being equal  we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not " he said  he expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting  at the end of the day  it is not a matter of simply producing profits  but being able to say where those earnings came from  said one investor  who manages a pension fund  some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce  tim o'brien  portfolio manager of the gabelli utilities fund  said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies  still  the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices  energy merchants include companies such as dynegy inc   dyn   duke energy corp   duk  and dominion resources inc   d   according to o'brien  the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above   - to   -times earnings  which were once paid for the stocks  "we all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are " o'brien said  adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens  as for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio  according to o'brien  "one analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays " o'brien said  that could mean stocks such as calpine corp   cpn   which is already in

15.0	today  enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview   of the company  here's an update of what we discussed during the call  we told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter  ests and to regain their confidence  our focus remains on our credit qualit  y  balance sheet and liquidity  which are essential for our continued succe  ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses  it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today  here's a snapshot   of significant events that led to our current situation  -- in hindsight  we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co  re businesses over the past several years  those include investments in azu  rix  india and brazil  they have performed far worse that we could have eve  r imagined when we made these investments  -- because of these bad investments  we've become over-leveraged as a compa  ny  the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex  tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet  -- we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in  vestor confidence  which has been very damaging  -- we've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under  stand financial and operating disclosures  and -- on top of it all  we discovered errors in our financial statements  as d  iscussed in our  -k filing last week  that required a restatement of previo  usly reported earnings  we've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three  areas  core businesses  non-core businesses  and businesses under review  core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear  nings and cash flows for the company  they're our competitive advantage  th  ese include  -- natural gas pipeline businesses  -- gas and power businesses in north america and europe  -- retail businesses in north america and europe  and -- coal businesses in north america and europe  the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou  r projected DATE profitability  it's too early to tell at this ti  me what impact this might have on our operating results  we are considering  these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in         i also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple   of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity   concerns  according to our business unit leaders  we have definitely seen i  mprovement in our counterparty relationships  non-core businesses our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d  ivision  we have invested more than MONEY in these businesses  and the  return from them has been dismal  we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect   that the sale of these businesses will generate MONEY in cash  that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses  we alre  ady have more than MONEY in assets contracted for sale this year  th  ey include ceg rio  a gas ldc in brazil  ecoelectrica  a power plant and ln  g receiving terminal in puerto rico  and asset sales of offshore oil and ga  s properties in india  the approximately MONEY portland general sale  is also on target to close in late      pending regulatory approvals  businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga  s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets  while sev  eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects  we need to dete  rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff  icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation  reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make  reductions to our work force  more information will follow as soon as it b  ecomes available  credit rating   -q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that   our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba  lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating  our current cr  edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows  -- moody's at baa  "under review for further downgrade" -- fitch at bbb- "evolving status" -- s p at bbb- "creditwatch negative" we also discussed our existing financial vehicles  including osprey  marlin  and yosemite  in further detail  we told investors that we will file our     -q five days late due to our current activities  it will be filed on nov        we will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we  ll as our frequent updates with you  the full transcript of our conference   call will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in the next   few days  it will also be posted on our web site at www enron com corp inve  stors

6.0	steve kean and i believe quite strongly  within a four peer group structure  that we need to allocate somewhere between    and    percent of gov't   public affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the gov't public affairs groups who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and direct impact on commercial activities  net income  these individuals should be moved to specialized technical     and others who are performing a less strategic function  who should remain in the commercial support category   with that said  it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for mid-year prc purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved  for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt   if we stay with the four group stucture  i intend to push hard for the remapping of gov't affairs by year-end  on a completely seperate issue  i continue to be very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups i'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- i just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there     the concern  simply stated  is that it may be entirely counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at enron  particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high   and that is even before you begin to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour  thanks

thought that it would be of benefit for you to und  erstand the unique situation that eml has from a regulatory standpoint  aft  er your review  we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss  if you co  ncur with the actions suggested  please advise  if there is any balance sh  eet  debtor creditor or cash forecast information that you require  please   let us know  drew lynch  kevin heffron  jonathan marsh  and joe gold introduction enron metals limited  eml  maintains a unique position within enron corp    eml is one of enron's two businesses regulated by the uk financial service  s authority  fsa - the uk financial regulator  and enron's only remaining b  rokerage business  given its special status  eml has responsibilities to i  ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the fsa and the l  me  metals exchange  of which it is a member  as a result of this regulato  ry oversight  there are several differences between eml and enron's other b  usinesses       eml must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato  ry rules relating  among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus  iness  failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d  isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers       by virtue of its position as an lme broker  there are certain circumst  ances in which eml is regarded as acting as agent for its clients  eml's p  olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible  however  eml's cond  uct is evaluated by the fsa in light of the potential for that relationship  to exist  how eml conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th  e fsa and the lme       because the fsa has a duty to protect the orderliness of uk markets an  d to protect against systemic risk  eml's position as a provider of liquidi  ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la  ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the fsa and the lme  as a co  nsequence of this concern  the fsa requires regulated entities to maintain   prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi  tion and credit risk  the rules relating to regulatory capital require fsa   regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc  e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem  ent  these rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital  which can be   used by way of regulatory capital  and a breach of these rules is regarded   as extremely serious  an ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ  irement usually results in the fsa issuing an order requiring the firm to c  ease carrying on business       eml's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o  versight by the fsa and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for  a breach of the rules  penalties for individuals include significant fines  and possible expulsion from the industry  the duties owed by board members  under the fsa's rules are in addition to those owed under general uk law r  elating to directors' duties  directors overriding ring fencing obligation in the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem  onstrate to the fsa that  to the full extent possible  the financial streng  th of eml is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t  he rest of enron  in order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation   we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below  issues surrounding liquidity as we are all aware over the past week  as a result of the reputation probl  ems the corporation has been faced with  we have substantially increased th  e hands on financial and managerial oversight of eml  this was a precautio  n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for eml  clearly the   goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing   of eml was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t  he non-eml related problems of enron  this of course needed to be accompli  shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated enron comp  any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was  concerned     the fsa does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains  and distributes its cash  in the event  that cash is lent outside of eml   it must be collateralised by an lc in order to preserve the regulatory cap  ital of the firm  however  the firm has a number of options to preserve its  day to day liquidity         in its position as an lme broker  eml must have access to cash for two purp  oses  first  it must be able to post margin to the london clearing house    lch   in the event that liquidity ever prevented eml from posting collater  al to the lch  it would be in breach of the lch rules and regulatory enforc  ement action could ensue  in addition it would be declared a defaulter and   the lch would have the right to close out all of its positions  second  it  must be able to post margin to its clients  a failure to make a contractu  al payment to a client would likely result in fsa action if it were referre  d to the fsa  a third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-  money clients in the event that they wish to close their account  while th  ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr  ofits  the failure of eml to make such payment would cause reputation quest  ions  previously  we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari  os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity  however ce  rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to   fruition and the amount of cash maintained by eml and its ring fencing from  the rest of enron has become a concern  eml has or is in the process of l  osing $           of unsecured lc's  which were primarily used in lieu of c  ash at the lch  eml has had to use its cash to replace or secure those lc'  s  additionally  a number of clients have requested that their accounts be  transferred  those transfers have reduced eml's cash balance  was the re  maining MONEY unsecured lc  which has been issued by a single bank  to be   withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid  ity impact  the work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo  r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality  therefore we have   agreed to start to do the following a    change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid  ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t  he rest of the enterprise b    improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control  as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of eml personnel c    manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints  of continuing to do business on a normal basis d    obtain financial information on a much more timely basis e    periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a  s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity f     undertake to formalize arrangements with emgl for provision of additi  onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou  r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis operational risk     in theory  eml could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account  s and rely on enron corp  for the remaining portion of its day to day cash   needs  eml's board have been resistant to this practice for several very p  ractical reasons  first  it is possible that the lch could unexpectedly ca  ll on eml to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis  i  f eml relied on enron corp 's daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs    it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at corp  or an acco  unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either  capital or liquidity events as eml's clearing account at citibank would be  substantially overdrawn  given the likelihood that an lch or fsa event mi  ght create a cascade for enron  eml's board is reluctant to put that much f  aith in the      accuracy of our operational safeguards  capital as noted above  eml is subject to the fsa's regulatory capital rules and mu  st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis  the fsa requires th  at eml notify it if its capital base is less than      of the minimum finan  cial resources requirement  for a variety of reasons  there were occasions  when eml violated the      threshold on occasions in       because these v  iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the fsa did not take enfo  rcement action and eml instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain  s financial resources in excess of      so that it has a sufficient buffer   not to trigger the fsa notification requirement  in the current climate the  fsa has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari  se from enron's perceived financial weakness  accordingly  if one of those   violations occurred today  the fsa would likely commence a formal investiga  tion of eml and could issue an order requiring eml to cease trading in ligh  t of the need to reassure the fsa and in light of the sizable changes in em  l's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily   basis  eml's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev  el of       clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces  s capital adequacy go hand in hand      liquidity and capital adequacy stress testing the stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce  narios  which would cause liquidity issues for eml      changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte  rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral  rather than cash resulting in eml financing these losses at the lch      changes in market prices causing additional losses by the eml house ac  count resulting in eml financing these losses at the lch      clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other lme   brokers      withdrawal of lch letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i  nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca  sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the lch directly         credit exposures leading to credit losses recommendations the result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following  changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov  erall operational liquidity      to fully draw down the remaining MONEY available under the MONEY s  ubordinated facility      to monetize the inter-company marked to market positions   MONEY       to increase the subordinated facility to MONEY and extend the maturi  ty by six months to DATE           to monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi  ts and other assets held by eml      to stop providing credit for in house enron counterparts and to switch  to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol  d for calling margin      to stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients  other th  an a select group of key relationship clients         to continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c  ompanies  emcl and emcc  therefore shifting the need for inventory finance current situation unsecured guaranty         MONEY

11.0	many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week  especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today  we want to encourage you to come to work  we continue to consider every option available to us as a company  and unfortunately  restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options  your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process  i still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy  but you should be aware that  in general  the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within    days of a petition filing to the extent of MONEY      per employee  i want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition  we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices  additionally  enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing  for enron  where our value is directly tied to our employees  making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority  we are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue  of course  until we finalize those business decisions  we cannot make that determination  i know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you  i can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so  while terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment  we hope to do what we can to assist them  we will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search  we have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in enron alumni  we will share more information on these efforts soon  i appreciate your continued patience and cooperation  ken

6.0	i agree with lindy  i don't believe we want to mention anything about "shipper imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this  in instances where socalgas happens to issue an operational flow order  "ofo"  during the intraday   cycle  it can create imbalances with transwesterns customers  because it does not afford transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties  when an ofo is issued in the intraday   cycle  an allocation is passed on to transwestern through the confirmation process with socalgas  due to the timing of these ofo's  transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with transwestern's upstream parties  if you have further questions  please give me a call  thank you  terry kowalke

6.0	i suggest we talk first  call me on the following cell phone    -   -        the difficulty i suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the  unknown  but in    days we will have everything nailed down  additionally   people  it would appear  seem to be making certain assumptions about the e  state which i believe are false  i can't see the estate continuing to spons  or green cards  or in maintaining the cash balance plan  at least in the fo  rm of the past  etc   etc   bankruptcy isn't pleasant      i would however  like to avoid selling netco at the estate's expense  as di  fficult as this may be      the main points we need to communicate and build around would be      salary - everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at   least at current levels job responsibility - this is entirely jay and jenny's call  if they see a p  erson as necessary to do a different job  they need to explain that  typica  lly  people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the curr  ent have  that would be the whole point of why netco needs them  clearly ne  tco will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite th  e same prominence it enjoyed with enron pre-bankruptcy  unfortunately  that  is lost forever  bonus - plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than enr  on's current arrangement  if we perform  retention - two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of   cash to be paid to the     people in netco who didn't get anything in nov    this would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a com  mitment for them to stay for   months or so otherwise they will have to rep  ay it  benefits - these will differ depending on who buys us  however  it each cas  e they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different  on the sp  ecific point of pension plan  they have plans that require some vesting per  iod but again the   main counter parties have agreed that they will take en  ron service into account  i e  if they have   years with enron and their pl  an requires   years service to vest they will vest immediately  but obvious  ly will get just their first years contribution   now is someone is   years  in with enron  i recognise this is not a great answer  but has to be contr  asted with how long there is a position in the estate for them  i e  is the  re a job for another    months   the last point concentrates too much on ne  gative aspects of what may happen to estate  so i would prefer to avoid too  much innuendo here  visa's - we have a plan to switch all h b visa's within    hours  this is a  pparently straight forward and neil and tim callahan and i have discussed l  ogistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail  on l 's  these wil  l take up to   weeks to switch to h 's  of the    people identified who hav  e visa's only about   or   have l 's  tindall and foster tell us this will   not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the cou  nter-parties who have agreed our approach  these people should avoid travel  ing outside us in this   weeks  but according to tindall and foster will be  legit  green cards - no easy solution  essentially these will have to start from s  cratch  the counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they wil  l support new applications  however  bear in mind i do not believe the enro  n estate will continue with green cards  although this has not been officia  lly proclaimed  expat terms - these will probably be honored by the new company  although e  ach counter-party has indicated a desire to "normalise" the terms with thos  e of their own company  over time  employment agreements - we have identified     across netco  the estate pla  ns to transfer these to the buyer  but it is clear that each prospective bu  yer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal  as such my working   assumption is that the offer letters each netco ee receives circa jan     w  ill supercede all previous terms including employment agreements  that indi  viduals may have had  specifically  i expect that the new employer will not  honor future equity  cash retention  target bonus or severance provisions   that may be in people contracts  clearly  there may be some negotiation her  e      now  we have other things like title's  prc  promotion dates  salary review  s  project bonuses  all employee stock option programs  etc   to figure out    but i think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises  after al  l the new employer will be probably one of the   biggest investments banks   in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over  the last    years  there may even be an ability to transfer  after a while  to a different part of their organisation  if they have an internal postin  g process       as to process from here  we want to identify those who don"t want to go and  why  i want to avoid anyone receiving an "offer" to switch and not accepti  ng it  as i mention above  many of the terms of the "offer" are unlikely to  be a huge surprise  and if people have genuine concerns i want to switch t  hem out now for someone who does want to go  we should have      acceptance    not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early wh  o had concerns  solving them or switching them out for someone else      jeanie amy michelle neil -

5.0	fyi    -----original message----- from  cantrell  rebecca w  sent  DATE                am to  concannon  ruth  townsend  judy  lamadrid  victor  muhl  gil  superty  robert  calcagno  suzanne  mcmichael jr   ed  smith  george f   pollan  sylvia s   kinsey  lisa  luce  laura  shireman  kristann  miller  stephanie  lucci  paul t   gay  randall l   sullivan  patti  hodge  john  tholt  jane m   kuykendall  tori  mahmassani  souad  south  steven p   shively  hunter s   grigsby  mike  neal  scott  gomez  julie a   sullivan  colleen cc  steffes  james d   lawner  leslie  neustaedter  robert subject  new ferc policy on negotiated rate deals this is an alert that ferc will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals  the orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that tennessee  anr and columbia had done  these provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates  but ferc has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative  thus  anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny  ferc adds another layer to policy on negotiated-rate authority acting on a series of contract-specific cases  ferc last week sharpened its policy on what is  and is not  allowed under negotiated rates  in further defining its policy  the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates  during discussion of the orders  chairman pat wood iii said it was "important to keep in mind  as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side " that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines " last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend " he asserted  in representative language  the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment  ferc declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers  in cases involving rates negotiated by anr pipeline co   gt  -    rp  -      tennessee gas pipeline co   rp  -     et al   and columbia gas transmission corp   cp  -     the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs  the provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals  while the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package  "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates  it said in the tennessee order  where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity  recourse service provides an "adequate alternative " the commission observed  "however  if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff  the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute  since recourse service would not include any such provision " a shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk  giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers " the commission pointed out  "a shipper's right to reduce  or terminate  its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right  since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges " ferc said  adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner " requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated" in a fair manner  ferc reasoned  once approved  the tariff language "will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers " commissioner linda breathitt applauded the policy shift  characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become "muddled " through a "tortured line of cases " ferc's definitions of allowable contracting practices were "obscured " breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense" approach  the "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers  she said

5.0	the alj submits her report to ferc to obtain ferc review of the southeast p  ower grid platform that resulted from the mediation            judge's final recommendations  ferc should consider adoption of grid mo  del  the one enron likes best  to fullest extent possible and that remainin  g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process  ho  wever  since complete consensus was not reached  ferc should provide its de  termination of which of the two models best meets ferc's expectations as a   platform for the se power grid rto  this should be done by ferc quickly    there should be no further delay  regardless of the model  ferc should enc  ourage the collaborative process  she thinks that this should be done by t  he parties without ferc intervention except to the extent to respond to fer  c orders   i think ferc staff should be involved or it will get bogged down     parties should reconvene within    days after ferc's order adopting a m  odel and the ferc order should direct the participants  like us  to submit   a joint proposal within    days thereafter  she recommends to ferc that pa  rties be allowed to file comments to ferc within    days  however  she reco  mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc  tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process   the commission  will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations  may reject he  r recommendations  or change something  i would expect that the commission  would adopt many of her recommendations  while allowing further mediated-t  ype discussions on some issues  hopefully  ferc will adopt many of our sugg  ested changes   judge mccartney then basically describes both proposals of  the grid group and the southern  etal  group  then provides the stakeholde  r participants' comments  almost verbatim from all submissions to her   wh  ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly  she does not ad  opt

accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input  r  egardless of the rto platform ultimately adopted by ferc    her opinion is that the "grid  entergy  gridsouth and gridflorida utility s  ponsored  model"  transco in rto  lmp financial rights congestion managemen  t  is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements  of order no       based on a "best practices"

and jim wyckoff  proprietor of "jim wyckoff on the markets " futuresource com  dave  give us a basic fundamental perspective on the u s  dollar and its major counterparts  hightower  the u s  dollar appears to have an entrenched bullish sentiment over the euro and we would expect interest in the dollar to increase into the kick-off of the physical euro currency implementation  however  it would

second time that the dollar has been quickly repelled from that level  we have been suggesting for weeks that the us dollar is holding an extreme premium versus most of the world's currencies  therefore  a leveling out of economic conditions would seem to pressure the dollar  we also think that the u s  dollar has seen an unsustainable windfall off of japanese yen weakness  therefore  it is possible that the dollar will see a blow-off top in the coming week and that a major top could be formed  historically  it would seem that several major turns in the currency markets have come in close proximity to the beginning of a new year  in the event that the dollar does turn down  we have to think that the canadian and the swiss will see the most significant recovery capacity  futuresource com  jim  give us more of a technical view on the u s  dollar index and the major imm currency futures  wyckoff  the past two weeks have seen the march u s  dollar index DATE sharply higher  after prices had been trending lower during late DATE and the first have of DATE  the march dollar index hit a high of         and has since seen some healthy consolidation of the recent strong gains  the dollar index bulls indeed have the near term edge  and the longer-term charts are also friendlier to the bulls  if the bulls can push the march dollar index above the        level

choppy and sideways trading range in the near term  bulls should be warned that if prices do sell off from here  a big head-and-shoulders top reversal pattern could develop on the weekly continuation chart for nearby dollar index futures  but right now  the bulls are enjoying the technical advantage  as for the euro currency  the weekly continuation chart for nearby euro futures should give the bulls some encouragement  as well as throw a scare into u s  dollar index bulls  a longer- term downtrend line drawn off the      high was penetrated on the upside and negated just about a year ago  since that time  prices have been trading sideways in a choppy pattern  this choppy trading has also formed a coiling pattern--whereby the sideways trading range has become more compacted the past several weeks  this is suggestive of a bigger "breakout-type" price move in the not-too-distant future  given the recent lowly price levels in the euro  odds do favor that potential breakout being to the upside  there is also potential for a big double-bottom reversal pattern on the weekly chart  indeed  there are clues on this chart that suggest the euro currency bulls will enjoy more success in the coming year than they did in the past year  from a shorter-term perspective  if march euro currency futures prices drop down below the DATE low of        then the door is opened to much more downside  if that low can hold and prices work higher  then a big double-bottom reversal could be in the works  finally  the japanese yen has been in a nosedive for nearly two months  this steep decline appears to be a "washout" or exhaustion-type selling phase that many times precedes a major change in trend  but bottom-pickers should beware  right now  would-be long-side traders do not want to stand in front of a steaming locomotive  they should first let the market show them some solid signals of strength before attempting to board the bullish train  futuresource com  thanks for the

9.0	nothing about bankruptcy is easy  and because of enron's size  ours is especially complex  so it is understandable that there might be confusion among employees of enron's various debtor and non-debtor companies surrounding the bankruptcy  to clarify  debtor-in-possession  or debtor  companies are the legal entities of enron that have filed for bankruptcy - their business activities are subject to the review and approval of the creditors' committee and the bankruptcy court  non-debtor companies are legal entities owned or controlled by enron that have not filed for bankruptcy - for the most part  non-debtor companies are able to operate their business as usual  the estate is made up of the combined assets and liabilities of enron  which include some holdings in non-debtor companies  it is important to note that at the beginning of march there were approximately        enron employees in non-debtor companies  and about       enron employees in debtor companies  distinctions between debtor and non-debtor companies become especially relevant for employees as we begin to roll out components of a transitional compensation program  as we work through restructuring  components of the program will apply differently to employees of debtor and non-debtor companies  for example  earlier this year some non-debtor companies were able to pay performance bonuses and merit increases to their employees as part of the ordinary course of business  another example is severance  going forward  we can anticipate gradual reductions in our workforce  given the uncertainty of our situation  we realize the importance of providing a "safety net " severance provides employees a degree of financial security in the event their jobs are terminated in the future  some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute a new severance plan for their employees  this was possible because the plan did not require the approval of the bankruptcy court  while the severance plan for debtor companies will be different than the plan for non-debtor companies  severance is part of a comprehensive retention and severance plan that will go to the bankruptcy court for approval  employees of debtor companies will be covered by either severance or retention  retention will become part of the compensation program for some employees  primarily those in debtor companies  retention offers employees an incentive to stay with the company to help develop a new business entity  to liquidate non-core assets  or to unwind the affairs of the estate  retention is not a measure of past performance  but is intended to retain key employees whose skills or historical knowledge are critical to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors  additionally  we are now finalizing merit increases and promotions for employees of debtor companies  supervisors in those companies will soon begin communicating merit increases or promotions to their employees  we hope this information further clarifies the bankruptcy's impact on our individual businesses  but more importantly  we hope it helps to establish realistic expectations and reduce some uncertainty for you as employees  to review a current list of enron's debtor companies  click on the following link  http   home enron com updates filedentities html
5.0	hey juan  bp has brought this cut back again claiming that you agreed to keep their purchase whole  however wri does not agree to booking out  per karen at bp you agreed to a MONEY price for he       from         tag       source sink ees  i have a copy of the tag at my desk in case you don't want to go digging through the tag archives  please look into this as soon as you can  this has been going on way too long and i have exhausted my resources in solving the issue  thanks  michael x     
6.0	paul  i don't doubt that the pjm summary has improved  as i have been pulling the data directly from edata instead of using the website  i will begin to record the difference and will talk with the web data folks in an attempt to understand where they are pulling the data  i have been using the updated website  i spot checked the zone p prices and there were few errors of little consequence  as for the ne physical  i was doing some analysis and unless i have my directions backwards   to  has been a pretty solid play  on the dap to daw and dap to rtw  da to rt has even been a pretty decent play during other hours  from the night shift i can't tell if this is not being scheduled because you are busy managing eol products or if there is some reason i don't have the experience to understand yet  i know this is your book and you will want to keep the earnings  i just noticed the opportunity appears to be there  if you would like we can do some of the analysis and pass it on to you to place the orders  another idea might be for you to tell us what you want to do in ny and you can decide what to do with it on the day shift  i do not want to step on your turf  at the same time " the times they are a changin'" you have done well with the books you have and as people come and go it is easy to see a scenario where you will be trading more during the day  as you move to use the ne physical book more for hedging  as gautam has used it  there may be a role for the    hour guys to take on more of the speculative portion of the physical market  it would seem to make sense to at least start getting the other guys thinking about that portion of the market by trying any of the ideas in the previous paragraph  it is kind of hard to talk about this over email  i would like to find a time to discuss it

12.0	the alj submits her report to ferc to obtain ferc review of the southeast p  ower grid platform that resulted from the mediation            judge's final recommendations  ferc should consider adoption of grid mo  del  the one enron likes best  to fullest extent possible and that remainin  g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process  ho  wever  since complete consensus was not reached  ferc should provide its de  termination of which of the two models best meets ferc's expectations as a   platform for the se power grid rto  this should be done by ferc quickly    there should be no further delay  regardless of the model  ferc should enc  ourage the collaborative process  she thinks that this should be done by t  he parties without ferc intervention except to the extent to respond to fer  c orders   i think ferc staff should be involved or it will get bogged down     parties should reconvene within    days after ferc's order adopting a m  odel and the ferc order should direct the participants  like us  to submit   a joint proposal within    days thereafter  she recommends to ferc that pa  rties be allowed to file comments to ferc within    days  however  she reco  mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc  tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process   the commission  will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations  may reject he  r recommendations  or change something  i would expect that the commission  would adopt many of her recommendations  while allowing further mediated-t  ype discussions on some issues  hopefully  ferc will adopt many of our sugg  ested changes   judge mccartney then basically describes both proposals of  the grid group and the southern  etal  group  then provides the stakeholde  r participants' comments  almost verbatim from all submissions to her   wh  ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly  she does not ad  opt any timeframes  we will comment that ferc should retain its dec    day     start date  for lmp financial rights congestion model to be implemented       the attachments below are her report  the southern  etal proposal and the g  rid pricing  congestion management  operating  and planning protocols  with  out any changes   clearly  our response ferc will include our proposed cha  nges to the documents  highlights from her report below  she recommends that spp pursue an rto coalition in the midwest    she encourages ferc to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr  ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input  r  egardless of the rto platform ultimately adopted by ferc    her opinion is that the "grid  entergy  gridsouth and gridflorida utility s  ponsored  model"  transco in rto  lmp financial rights congestion managemen  t  is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements  of order no       based on a "best practices" analysis of other rtos and c  ommission precedent  this is good because enron generally favors the grid   model  however  she does provide the commission information on southern  et  al 's proposal  independent system administrator--like national grid-type    in her report  even though she has concerns that the southern  etal model i  s not order no       compliant  the southern  etal  model has

of our comments from last week's response are included     judge mccartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners      many a  re still concerned that ferc had not conducted a "cost-benefit" analysis an  d had concerns over the costs  she responds that extrapolation of costs to  the entire se rto seems unwarranted because it ignores the "economies of s  cale" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure    in any event  ferc could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process  that would involve the state commissions      concerned about cost shiftin  g  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the commission has allo  wed      concern that se rto would preempt state ability to approve asset t  ransfers to rto and want state retail customers

collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners    i think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the   extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant "jump sta  rt" it gave to the se rto process due to the significant role played by jud  ge mccartney and her team on focusing the discussions  furthermore  the in  itial results after    days show the majority of participants favoring a "b  est practices" pjm spp cornerstone type real time spot energy market with l  mp pricing and financial congestion hedges and an rto with an independent b  oard structure that accommodates a for-profit rto entity with a significant  stakeholder advisory process  the commission should consider utilize the   fundamentals resulting from this

14.0	we know how interested all of you are in the retention   severance plan  so we want to update you on its status  as many of you know  we have been working with members of the creditors' committee and their consultants since DATE to formulate a retention   severance plan  and we formally presented the plan to the committee on DATE     we had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the DATE  we know that many of you have career options outside of enron and that the retention   severance plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave  we sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed  we're learning that  in bankruptcy  most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed  the committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan  but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns  the creditors' committee fully supports the implementation of a retention   severance plan  such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy  these plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate  the creditors' committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process  to that end  we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee  we intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible  this is currently our top priority  bar none  when we filed for bankruptcy  we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be  unfortunately  that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place  we now know that it takes significant time  resources and effort to understand  identify and gather the massive volume of required details  to formulate that information into a reasonable program  and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation  the process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which enron has been involved  that serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse  we remain committed to working with the creditors' committee until we can reach agreement on a plan  we anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so  and have targeted the week of march    to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court  we will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court  with respect to non-debtor companies  or those companies not in bankruptcy  new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future  in the meantime  we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week  and of course  we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible

6.0	adele  i reviewed the opinion and there were several changes to the form from the prior draft  i would like to discuss two of the additions with your counsel if that would be ok with you  the first addition at issue is subpart k at the end of the first paragraph on page two  it looks like we may need a representation from you that you are not and will not carry on investment business in or from within bermuda and that you will not perform your obligations under the agreement in or from within bermuda in order for the opinion to have value  the second addition at issue is subpart  e  under section   of the opinion  as written it looks like a large loop hole that can be taken advantage of just by finding evidence that was not submitted at the trial  our general counsel is concerned with what looks like an easy way to circumvent a foreign judgment  i would appreciate your thoughts or any clarification i can get  regards  brent hendry

14.0	dear mr  lay  recently i received notice that enron will no longer provide electric service for my residence "as a result of continued uncertainty in this market  as well as a lack of clarity on the future of direct access " i find this very disappointing and would like enron to re-consider this decision  i am a strong believer in the free market system and  in part  it was for this reason that i chose enron as my electric service provider several years ago when the market in california was deregulated  i also chose enron because of my knowledge of your company  its leadership and the strategic direction you have provided  never was there a time in the marketing of electric service to the state of california for a company such as enron to exhibit long range thinking   leadership  this is an opportunity for enron to show commitment and staying power in a market that has "radically changed" and lacking in clarity  i recognize it is not an easy decision to change a decision that has already been made  however  i also consider you a risk taking  strong and capable leader who wants to make the right decision for its ultimate customers in spite of short term political decisions  that will get changed  by governor davis

6.0	rob  markets my marks show how we believe the market would trade if the market were open today  considering neighboring markets  transmission wheeling costs  and fuel costs  more of a expected liquidation value vs  the current ontario market players bids and offers  the market on  yr  x   is being shown by a broker  MONEY$    and on the wholesale side i doubt the bid is actually there  or if so it is only a piece deep    mw   as a result  i would show an actually two way of MONEY$      and be coming from the sell side to the industrial customers who may pay in the MONEY  peak  my  yr mark is $    but given the often bullish nature of new markets  i would be a bid for this DATE and then look to offer the  yr in the low fifties  upcoming changes in the ontario system  nodal vs  zonal pricing  would have an effect on these term deals  staffing and services trading on the trading side  i will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off  an analyst and a temp it programmer for fundies development   analyst wise  i am interested in bringing brian loy back if he is still available  he has a good knowledge of the nug contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk  as our need for providing imo energy and operating reserve services  bidding for specific nugs and dispatchable loads  grows  it may be a good idea to bring heather mcillmurray over from the settlements group  i have had initial discussions with richard crouch  paul devries and heather on this matter  origination this is your area of expertise  i would suggest two originators and an analyst  if dan dorland is staying  he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team  and being the analyst to assist the oefc-nug point personnel  brian loy's previous role   it implementing the trading and vms systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue  i would suggest a short term   mo  contract with mike marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the estate and netco on trading and settlements systems  specifically david posten's vms team   his location should be in toronto  let's get on these issues as soon as possible  on specific personnel  i would have liked to have retained jeff borg and chris gaffney  office space tembec  our neighbor on this floor  has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space  if that interest remains  we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens  the origination desk pod  one conference room and storage area  not to include our server room   this would leave us with space for up to    people  two conference rooms    kitchen  as an alternative  we could consider moving upstairs into the enron direct location  potential conflict of interest i would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of estate or ubs relatively soon  specifically  the group that is leaving here  but will be participating in the ontario market  ubs ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential  if personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities  their access to ubs power   gas curves should be restricted  as time becomes available  we should get together and discuss ontario's business plan

14.0	today  we announced plans to merge with dynegy  a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties  dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own  we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build  following are the major components of the transaction  deal terms -- the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of        dynegy shares for every enron share  for example  each       shares of enron stock will be converted to     shares of dynegy upon closing  plus cash for fractional shares  upon closing  -- chevrontexaco owns approximately    percent of dynegy's outstanding common stock  chevrontexaco will invest MONEY in dynegy immediately and an additional MONEY in dynegy on closing of the merger  dynegy will immediately invest MONEY in cash in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas  -- total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately     million shares  -- the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  and is expected to close late next year  enron will have immediate access to dynegy's MONEY cash investment in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary  management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company  which will be called dynegy inc   and steve bergstrom will be president and coo  i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes  i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman  greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes  then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman  mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron  management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth  efficient integration  the make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined  the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the DATE       this merger will create an enormous growth engine  providing great opportunities for our employees  shareholders and customers  as with any merger  some elimination of positions is almost inevitable  and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company  we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions  clearly  we cannot rule out involuntary separation  but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations  i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible  as i said in my video  this is a day like no other in our company's history  we considered several options  but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence  strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses  i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps  we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at  http   home enron com updates    if you have additional questions  please submit them to questions enron com  mailto questions enron com   we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions  if you receive any calls from the media  please refer them to our media team at          -      i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company  rather than closing doors  we are opening new ones  as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise  including our market reach  financial strength and industry experience  together  we will be a new merchant powerhouse  and again  thank you for everything you have done for enron  investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available  because it will contain important information  investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement prospectus  when it is available  and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron  without charge  at the sec's web site at www sec gov  copies of the joint proxy statement prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either  investor relations  dynegy inc        louisiana  suite       houston  tx        phone           -

6.0	as discussed  what happens to my wages salary if the company files for bankruptcy protection  the general rule is that a company that has filed a banruptcy petition is not able to make payments on any prepetition debts until a plan of reorganization is filed  however  there are certain exceptions to the general rule  claims related to wages and salary earned within     days of a bankruptcy petition filing  called "prepetition wages and salaries"  receive a special priority for upt to MONEY the bankruptcy code  section     a      and are usually paid in full as part of the plan of reorganization  most companies that intend to continue operating while in bankruptcy recognize the need to keep employees working and the potential hardship that would occur of wages were not paid or delayed  as a result  most companies that file a bankruptcy petition  but which inetend to remain in business  seek the specific authority of the bankruptcy court to make payments on the priority wage claims immediately so that employees will experience little or no disruption in their wage salary payments while they continue working  usually this authority is sought at the same time or shortly after a bankruptcy petition is filed  for a company that derives a great deal of its value from its employees  making sure these payments are made in a timely manner is a high priority

19.0	i spoke with dale sanders at williams today  they seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way  regulatory filings  enviornmental and engineering work  i had previously put this project at a very low probablility  especially with the     mm d kern expansion in       i did not think that they would be able to get williams marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity  however  they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity  obviously that is the key to williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality  williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other         mmbtu d  i have to put that probability at still fairly low  but stranger things have happened  especially if williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the     mm d  probably the entire project is still less than     but it is obviously something to monitor very closely  if the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for cig and northwest  especially on the heels of the kern river expansion  in addition  the cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years  call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments
