14.0	today  we announced plans to merge with dynegy  a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties  dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own  we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build  following are the major components of the transaction  deal terms -- the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of        dynegy shares for every enron share  for example  each       shares of enron stock will be converted to     shares of dynegy upon closing  plus cash for fractional shares  upon closing  -- chevrontexaco owns approximately    percent of dynegy's outstanding common stock  chevrontexaco will invest $    billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $  billion in dynegy on closing of the merger  dynegy will immediately invest $    billion in cash in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas  -- total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately     million shares  -- the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  and is expected to close late next year  enron will have immediate access to dynegy's $    billion cash investment in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary  management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company  which will be called dynegy inc   and steve bergstrom will be president and coo  i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes  i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman  greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes  then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman  mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron  management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth  efficient integration  the make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined  the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter       this merger will create an enormous growth engine  providing great opportunities for our employees  shareholders and customers  as with any merger  some elimination of positions is almost inevitable  and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company  we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions  clearly  we cannot rule out involuntary separation  but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations  i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible  as i said in my video  this is a day like no other in our company's history  we considered several options  but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence  strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses  i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps  we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at  http   home enron com updates    if you have additional questions  please submit them to questions enron com  mailto questions enron com   we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions  if you receive any calls from the media  please refer them to our media team at          -      i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company  rather than closing doors  we are opening new ones  as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise  including our market reach  financial strength and industry experience  together  we will be a new merchant powerhouse  and again  thank you for everything you have done for enron  investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available  because it will contain important information  investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement prospectus  when it is available  and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron  without charge  at the sec's web site at www sec gov  copies of the joint proxy statement prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either  investor relations  dynegy inc        louisiana  suite       houston  tx        phone           -

5.0	wednesday february         pm eastern time businessweek online daily briefing -- can ubs tame enron's wild traders  daily briefing  news analysis by emily thornton in new york  david fairlamb in zurich  and stephanie anderson forest in dallas back in november  dynegy  nyse dyn  http   finance yahoo com q s dyn d t  - news  http   biz yahoo com n d dyn html   had what sounded like a great idea  buy enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity  and immediately become the dominant force in those markets  dynegy fled when enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal  now  zurich  switzerland -based ubs warburg  nyse ubs  http   finance yahoo com q s ubs d t  - news  http   biz yahoo com n u ubs html   is making the same bet  albeit for a lot less money  the question now  will the conservative bank be able to impose swiss order on the rogue texas company's traders  on one level  the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched  enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money  other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $  billion in pretax profits over the past two years  see bw             enron  how good an energy trader ''   still  ubs had good reason to go for a deal that gave it     of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of     enron employees  obviously  the enron name is mud  and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough  but managing enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder  culture clash  enron may be on its last legs  but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on  say insiders    even after going down in flames  a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability '' says a former enron trader who asked not to be named  competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $  million a year in the freewheeling  high-risk enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of ubs's massive fixed-income business  although many have signed contracts with ubs that prevent them from leaving enron for an undisclosed period    they're all exploring their options '' says one banker privately  indeed  some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from ubs after it gets going again  ubs says it's not worried about rogue traders    we're confident in the people we have hired '' says michael hutchins  global co-head of credit fixed income at ubs warburg  for the scheme to work  however  ubs must persuade enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices  and that will be tough  one reason enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks  analysts estimate that enron was willing to put as much as $   million at risk on a trade  vs  $     million at dynegy or $   million at duke energy  ubs warburg is willing to put up to $    million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner  but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk   anything like that'' on a single trade  ubs'ers abide by tighter controls than at enron    smoothing element '' ubs officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment  that's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income    earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets  so they could work as a smoothing element '' says ubs president peter a  wuffli  that's in fact what motivated ubs to send a small team down to houston when enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing  even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead  the swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly    we don't know how quickly this is going to start up '' says ubs ceo john costas    we'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically '' still  anything associated with enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price    it's not clear how successful ubs is going to be '' says jeff dietert  an analyst at investment bank simmons   co  in houston    and i think ubs knows that  that's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front '' some industry insiders doubt that enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules  but ubs isn't about to change its own way of doing business    entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk '' says wuffli  swiss family enron  don't bet the chalet on it  go to www businessweek com  http   rd yahoo com finance editorial bizwk  http   www businessweek com  to see all of our latest stories

6.0	after talking further with miso folks about the new attachment m  it appears that the miso will  effectively  be requiring physical losses  although they don't come out and say that  financial losses are essentially at the option of the to  so we "may" be able to do financial losses if the tos want to offer the service  in more detail  this is how the process will work  tcs will use the miso's loss calculator to identify impacted tos if all tos have provided financial loss pricing information  then it will be possible to buy losses if not  the tc will be required to self supply tos can change their loss pricing  or desire to offer financial losses  every    hours  effectively  this means it will be difficult at best to manage risk associated with having the fin rug pulled out from under us at scheduling time  i will continue to work on this issue with mike and push for a financial solution that provides for our needs

5.0	group  here is some input from tony at epe regarding running their system  i think the epe system was run very well on october   th  but aside from that  this email shows how closely they are watching our performance and what they expect  let's do our best to continue to provide them with good service  thanks  bill -----original message----- from  tsoto epec epelectric com  mailto tsoto epec epelectric com  sent  friday  october               am to  williams iii  bill cc  hpuente epec epelectric com  powermarketingfolks epelectric com  kpeterso epelectric com subject  displacing gas-fired generation bill  thanks for the visit we enjoyed it  it is always helpful to talk face to face and have some frank discussion regarding our current business relationship  hopefully  we'll be able to reciprocate with a visit in the near future  on a different matter  i was going over some recent historical data and have come across some instances where i believe we have room to displace gas-fired generation with inexpensive purchased power  in order to do this  we need to tighten up our real-time operations  by this  i mean to start putting all our gas-fired generation down to their minimums and replacing it with purchased power  this would apply to the early morning hours only  since we have some take or pay gas we still have to burn some base gas but this can be done during the day when prices are higher and our loss will be less   for example  thursday october     the unit commitment called for purchases of around     mw during the early hours  see attached unit commitment for amounts and times   we only purchased     mw net during this time frame  so we ended up generating around     mwh at around $   mwh when purchase power was available for $   mwh  furthermore  there was a sale for he       to enron caiso for $   mwh  when we enter this sale into our costing model  the sale will result in a loss of approximately $      for epe power marketing since the model will use marginal cost  gas-fired generation  to cost this sale  please look into this matter and call me if you have any questions or wish to discuss it further   see attached file  dispatch xls  tony soto power marketing    -

2.0	good news  it sounds like miso will offer a way to handle losses financially  based on their previously filed tariff  it appeared that they would not  but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new attachment m that details how they will handle losses financially  i have not yet seen the new attachment m  so it may be a complex or costly process  but hopefully  it will be fine  now  for the important question  miso does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules  either int or ext  in tag parlance  on dec     i don't think this is an issue for us  i expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules  dropping off losses along the path   if this is not correct  and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions  please let me know asap  also let me know how prevalent that practice is  miso is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on dec     while they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline  they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem  thanks

19.0	all  i am pleased to report that we have resolved the infamous james river contract with bpa under favorable terms  the signed agreements are on my desk right now  besides significantly reducing our litigation risk  the addition of     mw h and the change of delivery point have added $     million to the value of the contract  bpa and epmi have amended the original contract to specify that  i  bpa will deliver     mw h      for the  -year term of the agreement  an increase of     mw h over the original    ii  the disputed "alternative delivery point" is designated as mid-c   iii  all language to the contrary is deleted from the agreement   iv  the parties agree to "book out" the james river physical deliveries against epmi sales to bpa at the mid-c delivery point  so no power will flow   and  v  we will continue to invoice bpa each month for the term of the agreement  just as if the power was still flowing  although my preference would have been to terminate the james river agreement  bpa refused to do so because it would not have been able to recover the costs of this contract in its rates  similarly  i had hoped that we could do a one-time book-out  but bpa refused to do so because--according to bpa's finance person---such a book-out would have converted this to a financial deal requiring bpa to use mark-to-market accounting  therefore  we executed two documents  one amending the original contract  and another called the "book-out agreement " which sets out an agreement to book-out specific transactions over the next five years  i am satisfied that this is a favorable deal for epmi because     we resolve the disputes over quantity and delivery point  which     will make it very difficult for bpa to change its mind in the future and argue that we are not entitled to receive power unless we are selling it to james river  and     the negotiated increase in quantity and change in delivery point add over $   million in value to the contract  thanks to everyone for your help

14.0	we know how interested all of you are in the retention   severance plan  so we want to update you on its status  as many of you know  we have been working with members of the creditors' committee and their consultants since december to formulate a retention   severance plan  and we formally presented the plan to the committee on friday  february     we had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month  we know that many of you have career options outside of enron and that the retention   severance plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave  we sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed  we're learning that  in bankruptcy  most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed  the committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan  but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns  the creditors' committee fully supports the implementation of a retention   severance plan  such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy  these plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate  the creditors' committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process  to that end  we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee  we intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible  this is currently our top priority  bar none  when we filed for bankruptcy  we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be  unfortunately  that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place  we now know that it takes significant time  resources and effort to understand  identify and gather the massive volume of required details  to formulate that information into a reasonable program  and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation  the process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which enron has been involved  that serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse  we remain committed to working with the creditors' committee until we can reach agreement on a plan  we anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so  and have targeted the week of march    to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court  we will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court  with respect to non-debtor companies  or those companies not in bankruptcy  new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future  in the meantime  we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week  and of course  we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible

11.0	as you know  this is an unprecedented time in enron's history  we must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition  it is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs    clickathome - enron has suspended the clickathome program  the program will no longer accept new participants  pc orders  or internet service orders  orders submitted and confirmed prior to november          will be honored  enron will also discontinue subsidized internet service  effective january          employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service    matching gifts and volunteer incentive program  vip  - enron's matching gift program and vip grants have been suspended indefinitely  as we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time  it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations  matching gift or vip submissions received prior to november    will be honored  we regret that we have had to make these changes  we must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period

6.0	paul  i have been doing some analysis and have found a few problems that should be looked at     the number mother data is pulling for zone p is wrong  the pointer for the data can be found on the sql worksheet the expression is  avg decode prc power reference period cd 'dayahead'  decode pl location name 'pjm' price amt    pjm da  and avg decode prc power reference period cd 'hourly'  decode pl location name 'pjm' price amt    pjm rt  i have looked at the pjm and ny prices and am unable to figure out where the number is coming from     the other   hr desk evidently has been told that the pjm night shift is to prep the pjm and nepool portions of the shift notes  that is fine with me  i wrote a macro to pull  format and print the nepool information  the pjm information is not available on the website  the east power portal has something  i think it does some kind of op sum pull at some unknown interval  the problem is the information is not accurate  rob bensen's frustration with this bad information is the main reason the other   hr desk doesn't want any part of the reporting    a all data points are different than the one hour averages calculated in edata  this makes me doubt that opsum is the source  as edata also pulls from opsum    b when all interfaces and hubs are printing the same  the prices shown differ in the same hour on the website  i have no idea where this information is coming from but it is not right  if the correct data can be found there is an application that pulls from the database at "m  electric   hour pjm ave pjmsummary exe"  if they could fix this app i would care less about the web site  if they do not want to fix the app i can write a macro to pull the same data from the mother data template  i don't really care how i get the data  i just need to get yesterday's pjm for the shift note  in other news  if you are trading some of the regular products  are you following the da-rt physical moves  if we do man the   hr desk  even if bryce is the day guy  we could cover the da-rt physical  having it part of the   hr desk would seem to make sense because the evening load and more up to date weather forecasts could be used when entering the ny side in the early morning  i only mention this if you are finding yourself too busy trading pjm to spend the same amount of time on the analysis  it is certainly easier to do uninterrupted analysis on the back shift  just a thought

6.0	sanjeev  for your discussions with pacificorp we are pricing up the      coullee product only  it didn't appear beneficial to offer a very high price on the multi-stream deal that we really don't have a way to hedge  glenn is looking into the dual trigger pricing models that we used a year ago that actually settle vs  the power price trigger rather than      of the power value  this should be less expensive and more appropriately match pacificorp's risk exposure  i e  combination of low water  high prices   good luck with the meeting

investors don't trust enron by michael rapoport            dow jones news service  copyright  c        dow jones   company  inc   a dow jones newswires column new york - dow jones - if you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust enron corp   ene   here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock  enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value  it fell below that milestone weeks ago  no  now it trades for less than one-third of its book value  that's a rare level for a company of enron's size and prominence  and it may mean  among other things  that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures  much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly  first  let's be clear about what this means  enron stock is currently about $  a share  the company's reported book value is about $      a share  in other words  enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash  pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders  this is an uncommonly dismal level for any company  even a troubled one  for comparison's sake  dynegy inc   dyn   which has agreed to buy enron  trades at about three times book value  as does el paso corp   epg   a competitor of both companies  in fact  enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the standard   poor's    -stock index - only conseco inc   cnc   another troubled company  is lower  by an eyelash  part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that dynegy's agreement to buy enron will fall apart  and the belief that enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does  in which case enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value  the dynegy deal now amounts to about $      per enron share  itself well under enron's book value  the huge premium that level offers over enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form  but given enron's current woes  it's certainly also possible that enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of enron  those numbers  after all  are the raw material that form the basis for valuing enron  or any other company  by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios  and the enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers  with enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted  in terms of those numbers  the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $    billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships  when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $    million  and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $    million note   that deadline has now been extended until dec       when you've gotten punched in the face three times  it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow  no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be  given enron's insanely complicated structure  and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks  who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come  that's what investors appear to be fearing  and that may be part of the reason enron stock has fallen so precipitously  thanks to enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on  investors no longer

investors left holding the bag if enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by dynegy inc   dyn   over the last few years  citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $      billion in enron exposure  citigroup was instrumental in setting up enron credit linked notes trust  enron credit

securities ratings at standard   poor's  as long as enron remains out of bankruptcy  citigroup continues to make payments on the notes  ryan said  if enron defaults  citigroup would cease making payments to the trust  the single-a-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default enron debt obligations  and with speculation mounting that dynegy will reduce  or maybe even scrap  its offer to buy enron  the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising  these notes essentially are synthetic enron debts  meaning they act like enron bonds in many respects  but lack key components that make holders true creditors of enron  for instance  the holders of these notes  because they don't possess actual enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt  it has been reported that enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors  the synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to enron's rating of triple-b-minus from standard   poor's and baa  from moody's investors

is canceled  or it is restructured - the first is the least likely  "escape clauses" built into the dynegy-enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in enron's business or assets  "dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has already been triggered  either by the $    million loan being accelerated  earnings  being  down or the ongoing trading business weakness " he said  last week enron said it could be forced to pay a $    million debt this week because of a credit downgrade  but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-december  enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability  continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for dynegy  "every day that goes by where enron trading volumes become less  it decreases the

lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated $    million on enron stock held in their      k  retirement accounts  the suit is the third one filed against enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices  all three suits seek class-action status  enron's

hold    percent of their portfolio in that stock  "congress sensibly placed a    percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in       but at the behest of the corporate lobby  it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans " he said  the absence of such a cap in defined-contribution      k  plans was "completely indefensible " he said  gottesdiener's suit

traders' perfect storm stalls by christina cheddar            dow jones news service  copyright  c        dow jones   company  inc   of dow jones newswires  this story was published originally friday  new york - dow jones - here's one      outlook that couldn't have been more wrong  around this time last year  pundits and fund managers were touting "the perfect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in       then came the california power crisis  and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group  that was followed by renewed volatility in power prices  and this time the prices were headed down  not up  and then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player  enron corp   ene   simply put  the perfect storm stalled  and a business once buoyed by high gas prices  strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters  the stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade  and the chance for recovery in       basu mullick  portfolio manager of the neuberger berman partners fund  is willing to bet there is  he thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median  which is currently between   - to   -times future earnings  he said  it's just a matter of time before the stocks get there  "they were just recovering from gray davis " mullick said  referring to the governor of california  who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state  and triggering the state's energy crisis  "now  they are recovering from enron " the fund manager also blames lower commodity prices  warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group  "energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates " he said  "i don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility " still  others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures  enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues  although many of enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues  there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create  answers elude investors investors are asking hard questions  and not always getting the answers they want  using mark-to-market methods  a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract  an option  a swap  etc  - at the time  even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period  the problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment  also  sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position  this is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid  over time  companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure  said abn amro inc  analyst paul patterson  encouragingly  it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure  according to a survey patterson conducted  more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter  patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based  "all things being equal  we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not " he said  he expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting  at the end of the day  it is not a matter of simply producing profits  but being able to say where those earnings came from  said one investor  who manages a pension fund  some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce  tim o'brien  portfolio manager of the gabelli utilities fund  said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies  still  the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices  energy merchants include companies such as dynegy inc   dyn   duke energy corp   duk  and dominion resources inc   d   according to o'brien  the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above   - to   -times earnings  which were once paid for the stocks  "we all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are " o'brien said  adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens  as for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio  according to o'brien  "one analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays " o'brien said  that could mean stocks such as calpine corp   cpn   which is already in the lower-half of its trading range  may have further to fall  -by

5.0	this is an alert that ferc will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals  the orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that tennessee  anr and columbia had done  these provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates  but ferc has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative  thus  anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny  ferc adds another layer to policy on negotiated-rate authority acting on a series of contract-specific cases  ferc last week sharpened its policy on what is  and is not  allowed under negotiated rates  in further defining its policy  the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates  during discussion of the orders  chairman pat wood iii said it was "important to keep in mind  as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side " that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines " last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend " he asserted  in representative language  the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment  ferc declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers  in cases involving rates negotiated by anr pipeline co   gt  -    rp  -      tennessee gas pipeline co   rp  -     et al   and columbia gas transmission corp   cp  -     the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs  the provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals  while the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package  "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates  it said in the tennessee order  where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity  recourse service provides an "adequate alternative " the commission observed  "however  if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff  the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute  since recourse service would not include any such provision " a shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk  giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers " the commission pointed out  "a shipper's right to reduce  or terminate  its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right  since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges " ferc said  adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner " requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated" in a fair manner  ferc reasoned  once approved  the tariff language "will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers " commissioner linda breathitt applauded the policy shift  characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become "muddled " through a "tortured line of cases " ferc's definitions of allowable contracting practices were "obscured " breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense" approach  the "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers  she said

11.0	today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued  recent news reports  including the wall street journal article today  have speculated about possible mergers  takeovers and equity investors as options that enron is considering  the reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation  however  i will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company  i will keep you updated on developments as they occur

15.0	today  enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview   of the company  here's an update of what we discussed during the call  we told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter  ests and to regain their confidence  our focus remains on our credit qualit  y  balance sheet and liquidity  which are essential for our continued succe  ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses  it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today  here's a snapshot   of significant events that led to our current situation  -- in hindsight  we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co  re businesses over the past several years  those include investments in azu  rix  india and brazil  they have performed far worse that we could have eve  r imagined when we made these investments  -- because of these bad investments  we've become over-leveraged as a compa  ny  the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex  tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet  -- we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in  vestor confidence  which has been very damaging  -- we've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under  stand financial and operating disclosures  and -- on top of it all  we discovered errors in our financial statements  as d  iscussed in our  -k filing last week  that required a restatement of previo  usly reported earnings  we've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three  areas  core businesses  non-core businesses  and businesses under review  core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear  nings and cash flows for the company  they're our competitive advantage  th  ese include  -- natural gas pipeline businesses  -- gas and power businesses in north america and europe  -- retail businesses in north america and europe  and -- coal businesses in north america and europe  the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou  r projected fourth quarter profitability  it's too early to tell at this ti  me what impact this might have on our operating results  we are considering  these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in         i also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple   of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity   concerns  according to our business unit leaders  we have definitely seen i  mprovement in our counterparty relationships  non-core businesses our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d  ivision  we have invested more than $  billion in these businesses  and the  return from them has been dismal  we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect   that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash  that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses  we alre  ady have more than $    million in assets contracted for sale this year  th  ey include ceg rio  a gas ldc in brazil  ecoelectrica  a power plant and ln  g receiving terminal in puerto rico  and asset sales of offshore oil and ga  s properties in india  the approximately $    billion portland general sale  is also on target to close in late      pending regulatory approvals  businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga  s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets  while sev  eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects  we need to dete  rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff  icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation  reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make  reductions to our work force  more information will follow as soon as it b  ecomes available  credit rating   -q filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that   our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba  lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating  our current cr  edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows  -- moody's at baa  "under review for further downgrade" -- fitch at bbb- "evolving status" -- s p at bbb- "creditwatch negative" we also discussed our existing financial vehicles  including osprey  marlin  and yosemite  in further detail  we told investors that we will file our     -q five days late due to our current activities  it will be filed on nov        we will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we  ll as our frequent updates with you  the full transcript of our conference   call will be filed with the securities and exchange commission in the next   few days  it will also be posted on our web site at www enron com corp

6.0	lisa  i am comfortable that the order setting the administrative claim bar date applies only to claims arising from the post-petition sale of power through the caiso  my understanding  based on an email from john  is that power sales under bilateral contracts  such as the epmi power contract  do not go through the iso  assuming that is correct  and if john or elizabeth disagree  please let me know immediately   i am comfortable that there is no need to file an administrative claim for power sales under the epmi contract for the period april   to april    similarly  the post-petition negative ctc claim does not arise from the sale of power through the iso  thus  there is no need to file an administrative claim for it at this time

    on whole the centerpiece of tw's interest in this proceeding remains intact  the socal receipt points are unbundled along with "socal backbone facilities"  tw has primary firm rp of no less than     mmfcd  mojave is recognized at only    mmfcd firm rp  no receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion  line     appears to remain useful for tw deliveries into the market load centers  the pd modifications to the csa do not impose upon tw any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support the pd  the parties most affected by the pd are the core aggregators with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore customers with additional cost allocations  points for comments    tw agrees with the pd that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the csa in the creation of firm tradable rp rights  this change in socal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts     further adoption of the pd substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the california border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty     the creation of tradable secondary rights on socal's intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices     the pd correctly observes that the pg e market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during california's challenging energy markets    tw agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the pd  the energy markets in california have been improving and stabilizing  the commission promising options are still valid in today's gas market  further  socal is already starting to follow the csa game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the socal system  it is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these improvements    tw supports socal and others whom are approving this pd   on this point  tw should be sure that socal is on board as well as other csa signatories  prior to filing these type comments  i look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call  mark  igs  mark  igs

that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates  during discussion of the orders  chairman pat wood iii said it was "important to keep in mind  as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side " that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines " last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend " he asserted  in representative language  the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment  ferc declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers  in cases involving rates negotiated by anr pipeline co   gt  -    rp  -      tennessee gas pipeline co   rp  -     et al   and columbia gas transmission corp   cp  -     the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs  the provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals  while the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package  "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates  it said in the tennessee order  where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity  recourse service provides an "adequate alternative " the commission observed  "however  if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff  the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute  since recourse service would not include any such provision " a shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk  giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers " the commission pointed out  "a shipper's right to reduce  or terminate  its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right  since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges " ferc said  adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner " requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated" in a fair manner  ferc reasoned  once approved  the tariff language "will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers " commissioner linda breathitt applauded the policy shift  characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become "muddled " through a "tortured line of cases " ferc's definitions of allowable contracting practices were "obscured " breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense" approach  the "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers  she said

it is rationale that these phenomena would be studied and acted  read traded  upon in order to minimize tw's market risk  read generate income   tw can setup a risk management group to execute this idea  it is not unusual for a pipeline to have a risk management function - duke pipeline for example has a vp of risk management for pipelines  these "events" would be studied in the follow way -    determine whether there is a correlation between an "event" and gas prices basis differentials  - based on historical data     for those events that have a strong correlations  develop a trading strategy around the relationship     back-test the trading strategy against historical data - determine profitability     for operational "events" that are applicable  setup a system to execute program trading that is directly linked to scada  secondary benefits of this risk management  trading  strategy  would be developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of selling the capacity physical vs  through basis derivatives   or some combination of both  steve  if you are interested in this idea i can start drawing up a workplan for this study  dave david a  foti accenture      allen parkway  suite      houston  texas              -

1.0	today  we announced plans to merge with dynegy  a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties  dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own  we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build  following are the major components of the transaction  deal terms -- the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of        dynegy shares for every enron share  for example  each       shares of enron stock will be converted to     shares of dynegy upon closing  plus cash for fractional shares  upon closing  -- chevrontexaco owns approximately    percent of dynegy's outstanding common stock  chevrontexaco will invest $    billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $  billion in dynegy on closing of the merger  dynegy will immediately invest $    billion in cash in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas  -- total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately     million shares  -- the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  and is expected to close late next year  enron will have immediate access to dynegy's $    billion cash investment in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary  management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company  which will be called dynegy inc   and steve bergstrom will be president and coo  i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes  i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman  greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes  then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman  mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron  management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth  efficient integration  the make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined  the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter       this merger will create an enormous growth engine  providing great opportunities for our employees  shareholders and customers  as with any merger  some elimination of positions is almost inevitable  and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company  we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions  clearly  we cannot rule out involuntary separation  but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations  i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible  as i said in my video  this is a day like no other in our company's history  we considered several options  but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence  strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses  i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps  we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at  http   home enron com updates    if you have additional questions  please submit them to questions enron com  mailto questions enron com   we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions  if you receive any calls from the media  please refer them to our media team at          -

6.0	i agree with lindy  i don't believe we want to mention anything about "shipper imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this  in instances where socalgas happens to issue an operational flow order  "ofo"  during the intraday   cycle  it can create imbalances with transwesterns customers  because it does not afford transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties  when an ofo is issued in the intraday   cycle  an allocation is passed on to transwestern through the confirmation process with socalgas  due to the timing of these ofo's  transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with transwestern's upstream parties  if you have further questions  please give me a call  thank you

2.0	attached is a presentation for your review that illustrates a new method for curtailment of transactions that is still based on cpm  but give partial-credit for varying levels of firmness in a stack  as you probably know  when a transaction leg is supported by multiple transmission reservations it is referred to as a "stack" of transmission  specifically  a vertical stack  under the current curtailment procedures under which we operate  such a stack is always valued at the lowest curtailment priority of the stack  in other words  if i combine   mw of firm transmission and   mw of non-firm secondary  my    mw of transmission capacity is now treated as if it all had a curtailment priority of    further  if an off-path constraint occurs  the entire transaction is treated with a priority of    even if every other leg is firm  as i'm sure you can see  this stinks  so i have drafted up a proposal for what i think is a better way of doing this  under the proposal    mw would be treated as priority    while the other    would be treated as firm  this would reduce the size on-path curtailments and off-path curtailments  as far as whether it increases or decrease the number of transactions curtailed  that will depend on several different factors  how prevalent stacking is  how often stacks vary in firmness  etc      please review and give comments  as i plan to present to the idcwg in a few weeks  it is my opinion that this is a good idea  but i want to make sure you all  and any others you think should be asked  agree

14.0	yesterday  enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas  our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline  dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron's right to repurchase until june     we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy  while we would like to keep northern natural  we still have some       miles of safe  profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses  the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $   billion damage claim against dynegy  it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts  we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas  below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services  ken dear ets colleague  on thursday  enron entered into a settlement over dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline  the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy  in this respect  enron corp  has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas  consequently  enron corp  has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy  while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved  the company has concluded that with this settlement  enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly  as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court  for the northern natural gas employees  i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable  successful business  beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe  reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas  over many years we have run high quality  cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets  keep up the good work  stan

6.0	mark just a quick question while i remember  as you know i am giving an overview of the dash process and the legal risk memo that must accompany any dash  my understanding is that the legal risk memo must be attached to the dash when the dash is circulated and that on the face of the dash form prepared by rac  we should not be and there should not appear any legal risk assessment  which must only be contained in the legal risk memo  the dash should simply refer to "see attached legal risk memo"  i am hoping that this is also how you like to see the process work in practice  in addition i am going to say that if possible you need to be briefed and receive a draft of the legal risk memo before it is circulated with the dash  see you shortly  marcus

14.0	today  we announced plans to merge with dynegy  a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties  dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own  we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build  following are the major components of the transaction  deal terms -- the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of        dynegy shares for every enron share  for example  each       shares of enron stock will be converted to     shares of dynegy upon closing  plus cash for fractional shares  upon closing  -- chevrontexaco owns approximately    percent of dynegy's outstanding common stock  chevrontexaco will invest $    billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $  billion in dynegy on closing of the merger  dynegy will immediately invest $    billion in cash in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas  -- total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately     million shares  -- the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  and is expected to close late next year  enron will have immediate access to dynegy's $    billion cash investment in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary  management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company  which will be called dynegy inc   and steve bergstrom will be president and coo  i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes  i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman  greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes  then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman  mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron  management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth  efficient integration  the make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined  the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter       this merger will create an enormous growth engine  providing great opportunities for our employees  shareholders and customers  as with any merger  some elimination of positions is almost inevitable  and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company  we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions  clearly  we cannot rule out involuntary separation  but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations  i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible  as i said in my video  this is a day like no other in our company's history  we considered several options  but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence  strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses  i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps  we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at  http   home enron com updates    if you have additional questions  please submit them to questions enron com  mailto questions enron com   we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions  if you receive any calls from the media  please refer them to our media team at          -

7.0	ken-- for what it's worth  here's a little perspective from some distance  a billion dollars here  a billion there  it's adding up to serious numbers  but even worse is the loss of what was once  not long ago  a great stock of trust and credibility  both for enron and ken lay personally  sunday's ny times front page of the business section story is about as bad as it gets  short of suspicions of personal dishonesty or criminal culpability  suspicion or innuendo that maybe you didn't fully understand the deals must hurt as bad as any of the barbs  the old dumb-but-honest defense is not something you want to use in this case  anyway  and i doubt you could convince many people you didn't understand it  the analogy of clinton   nixon in their darkest hours comes to mind  nixon's "i am not a crook" speech or clinton's "i did not have sex with that woman" did not fix their problems  when things get this bad the best  maybe only  way to re-coup is get really candid and lay all the cards on the table face up  with one important caveat about which more later   humility  contrition   candor are the antidotes for hubris  arrogance   deviousness  whether they were real or just perceived  in whatever the right venue is  and i'm unsure on that  i'd like to see you tell the world  this is what we did  this is why we did it  this is why we were confident it was wholly proper  this is why it didn't come out as well as we had hoped  this what we believe it might cost us when all is said   done  and i will answer any questions you have on any of this because we have to get it behind us and get on with running an ongoing business  with the press on your case  and the sec  and enron's high bush-related profile  and its critical position in the markets  and the tantalizing non-coincidence of jeff's recent sudden departure -- this is a story that has legs  it's going to sell newspapers  fuel gossip and energize competitors until the fire's out and the smoke has dissipated  national tv coverage is a possibility even  but for anthrax and osama-gate  for you to try to spoon-feed the pack on your heels will just make the story last longer and get juicer  only a pre-emptive total disclosure can quench it even half as quickly as you'd hope for  but the caveat  if anybody is exposed to personal criminal liability  then it ain't nearly so simple  in those circumstances  the best attorney you can get will have to counsel every move  and both the person and the corporation would need their own separate lawyers because interests can diverge very fast  i don't think for a minute that this is a real issue  but i didn't think i'd see a $   stock price either  the enormity of this quake has shaken even those who only wish you the best  imagine how good it makes the hyenas feel  as i said before  lots of luck  buddy  you need it worse that i ever thought you would  kindest regards to linda  too  ross

6.0	i agree with christian that we cannot win over the wspp folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours  everytime i venture out to the larger nw community of ious  munis  and federal pma's i realize that the wspp is more than a contract  it's almost a religion  one cannot convince a muslim that the bible is better written than the koran  whether it's assimilation or merger  or the hint that the wspp might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education  we need to give mike small a face-saving way of relinquishing the wspp contract  modifying the wspp to look like the eei only strengthens the resolve of wspp-ers to stick with the original contract ---"why should i change  the agreements are virtually identical "

6.0	as discussed  what happens to my wages salary if the company files for bankruptcy protection  the general rule is that a company that has filed a banruptcy petition is not able to make payments on any prepetition debts until a plan of reorganization is filed  however  there are certain exceptions to the general rule  claims related to wages and salary earned within     days of a bankruptcy petition filing  called "prepetition wages and salaries"  receive a special priority for upt to $     under the bankruptcy code  section     a      and are usually paid in full as part of the plan of reorganization  most companies that intend to continue operating while in bankruptcy recognize the need to keep employees working and the potential hardship that would occur of wages were not paid or delayed  as a result  most companies that file a bankruptcy petition  but which inetend to remain in business  seek the specific authority of the bankruptcy court to make payments on the priority wage claims immediately so that employees will experience little or no disruption in their wage salary payments while they continue working  usually this authority is sought at the same time or shortly after a bankruptcy petition is filed  for a company that derives a great deal of its value from its employees  making sure these payments are made in a timely manner is a high priority

energy trader dynegy inc  confirmed on tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival enron corp  over their proposed merger  as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some    percent  "i can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal " dynegy spokesman john sousa told reuters  he declined to give further details  dynegy had planned to buy its houston rival for $  billion in stock and is currently in a "due diligence" examination of enron's complex financial books that began before the thanksgiving holiday last thursday  the buyout offer  finalized nov     would have had dynegy paying about $      for each share of enron  but enron's shares have since cratered to near $   stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all  the stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of        of each dynegy share for each enron share to around      instead  sources familiar with the matter told reuters  enron is willing to accept the lower valuation  given the pressure on its stock price  the sources said  enron's shares bounced on dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks  trading up    cents at $     in late afternoon action on the new york stock exchange  the shares had dipped as low as $     in late-morning dealings and as high $      dynegy's shares gained     percent or $     to move to $      on the nyse  also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of enron's debt past the close of the merger  expected in the third quarter of       the sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $    million in cash  which enron has said it was seeking  there also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the northern natural gas pipeline  which would be dynegy's consolation prize if the deal fell apart  a source said  published reports have said that investment banks j p  morgan and salomon smith barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans  and may dispute dynegy's ownership if the deal breaks up  "the pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized  there's a solid earnings stream from that thing " said one source familiar with the discussions  one trading unit shut down two sources confirmed to reuters that enron's equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly    employees there are being laid off  enron was not immediately available for comment  those layoffs  part of broader job cuts expected as part of the dynegy buyout  point to an acute problem for enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise  enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactions with north america's largest energy trader because of credit concerns  "this business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth  it is the principal reason that dynegy is making the deal  if it's worth a lot less then enron is worth less  it's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business " said commerzbank analyst andre meade  but as enron's stock continued to lose value  down over    percent since dynegy's initial bid  it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well  enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $  billion  from $   billion at the start of        additional reporting by jeff goldfarb  janet mcgurty and jonathan stempel in new york   copyright        dow jones   company  inc  all rights reserved  rpt dynegy confirms in talks on structure of enron merger deal            afx news  c       by afp-extel news ltd  repeating to clarify lead  new york  afx  -

ruling on retail rates   which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin  king profits in their wholesale operations  while ferc has presented this r  uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience  d in the california market  the new limits on wholesale transactions can al  so be seen as another example of the "big stick" that the commission is usi  ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat  ions  rto   further  the ruling is another striking indication that chairma  n wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m  arkets while still attempting to support competition  the objective represe  nts a tall order  and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom  pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading     put into a nutshell  ferc has ruled that some companies can no longer charg  e unregulated  market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions  i  nstead  companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of  an approved rto must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committ  ed in a long-term contract  and publicly disclose those cost-based prices    columbus  ohio-based american electric power  nyse  aep   atlanta-based sou  thern company  nyse  so  and new orleans-based entergy corp   nyse  etr  ha  ve been singled out as case studies on which ferc will be immediately apply  ing its new standards for wholesale transactions  note that mirant corp   a  former subsidiary of southern company  has also been identified as having   to submit information to ferc in order to gauge its level of market power s  eparate from its former parent  the commission has essentially determined t  hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the  areas in which they operate  under ferc's new market power "test " a gener  ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici  ty is "pivotal" during peak demand  which enables the company to demand a p  rice above competitive levels  regional transmission constraints will also   be considered now as a measurement of a company's market power  this is a d  ramatic departure from previous standards  by which  under one of ferc's ma  in criterions  a company that supplied less than    percent of the power ne  eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l  evel     there are some important exceptions to the ruling  first  ferc has not elim  inated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where t  he grid and markets are controlled by a ferc-approved rto  this is signific  ant  as i will expand upon subsequently  because it indicates that there ar  e secondary objectives in ferc's new ruling  in addition  the current rulin  g only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities  are involved  in other words  long-term contracts that the three companies  may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im  pacted by the ruling  however  the three companies named in the ruling will  have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts  and ferc   has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term co  ntracts may be necessary  also note that the western market  which already   is under a price mitigation policy that ferc imposed in june  was not inclu  ded in the new ruling     the three utilities named in the ruling now have    days to submit proposal  s to ferc outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for  all power not currently committed to a buyer  specifically  the utilities   will have to post on their open-access same-time information systems  oasis    the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour   in a   -hour period  moving forward  the price that the utilities can charg  e for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between  their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region  that their power displaces  the new cost-based rates must be administered   by an independent third party     the new pricing standards revert back to an older  cost-based technique kno  wn as "split the savings " the methodology for this standard can get rather  complicated  but essentially under ferc's new ruling the three companies i  dentified will have to post their cost-based  incremental costs for spot po  wer into the oasis system for viewing by potential purchases  purchasers wh  o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci  ng or buying the power on their own  the final price for the transactions w  ill be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decr  emental bid  for instance  if southern company bids its incremental cost at  $   mwh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $   mwh  the transact  ion price would be $   mwh  assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day  se  llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da  y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by   p m  what this potent  ially creates is an "information advantage" for buyers who have six hours t  o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers  some of t  he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price  information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th  e purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original in  cremental bid and competing around the seller's price     note also that in a separate development ferc simultaneously opened a broad  investigation under section     of the federal power act to apply the new   market-based-sales policy to all u s  sellers nationwide  what this means i  s that  although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order    it is expected that ferc will continue to take steps to constrain what it b  elieves to be erratic wholesale markets  reportedly  some    companies are   awaiting similar reviews by ferc to determine if the commission believes th  ey exert market power  the     investigation reportedly also requires power  providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within      days to provide ferc with open-ended authority to order refunds if the c  ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred     i made a previous reference to the "big stick" that ferc is carrying relate  d to participation in rtos  remember that a few months ago  chairman wood h  ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an rto the benefits of  charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli  cations  advantages that the chairman equated with the "new world" of the d  eregulated energy market  with this in mind  note that only southern compan  y  entergy and aep are included in the present ruling  although it may be s  ubsequently expanded   southern company and entergy in particular have exhi  bited some resistance in following ferc's consolidation mandate regarding n  ational rtos  so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti  lities have been singled out  this must be particularly painful for souther  n company  which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an  d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov  er the next five years     interestingly  commissioner linda key breathitt represented the single diss  enting vote in the ruling  breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been  pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu  ate the impact on wholesale markets  this issue will undoubtedly be contest  ed  and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to   have been caught off-guard  aep  entergy and southern company all issued st  atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t  he ruling would impact them  and that they were reserving the right for pos  sible litigation     moreover  to summarize the commission's rulemaking  i think there are a han  dful of important points that should be considered  first  the ruling illus  trates the steps that ferc is taking to revoke market-price authority that   was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that pat wood assumed   his post as chairman  second  ferc is implementing cost-based prices on the  spot market only  and in only very defined circumstances  however  this co  uld be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to o  ther wholesale transactions  including long-term contracts  at a later time    third  the "split the savings" cost-based formula could become fraught wi  th its own problems  its requirements are rather complex and it offers the   potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov  er power sellers  which will now be required to post incremental costs in t  he bidding process  finally  one of the inherent drivers of ferc's new ruli  ng is its desire to have large utilities join the rtos that the commission   has approved  it is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact  s aep  entergy and southern company  utilities that have not only been deem  ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a  lso not yet joined an approved rto  however  even though only three compani  es are immediately impacted by this ruling  it should not be overlooked tha  t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi  ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain   areas  thus  overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s  ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power  market are conducted     an archive list of previous issuealert articles is available at www scientech com  http   secure scientech com issuealert

12.0	the alj submits her report to ferc to obtain ferc review of the southeast p  ower grid platform that resulted from the mediation            judge's final recommendations  ferc should consider

consensus was not reached  ferc should provide its de  termination of which of the two models best meets ferc's expectations as a   platform for the se power grid rto  this should be done by ferc quickly    there should be no further delay  regardless of the model  ferc should enc  ourage the collaborative process  she thinks that this should be done by t  he parties without ferc intervention except to the extent to respond to fer  c orders   i think ferc staff should be involved or it will get bogged down     parties should reconvene within    days after ferc's order adopting a m  odel and the ferc order should direct the participants  like us  to submit   a joint proposal within    days thereafter  she recommends to ferc that pa  rties be allowed to file comments to ferc within    days  however  she reco  mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc  tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process   the commission  will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations  may reject he  r recommendations  or change something  i would expect that the commission  would adopt many of her recommendations  while allowing further mediated-t  ype discussions on some issues  hopefully  ferc will adopt many of our sugg  ested changes   judge mccartney then basically describes both proposals of  the grid group and the southern  etal  group  then provides the stakeholde  r participants' comments  almost verbatim from all submissions to her   wh  ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly  she does not ad  opt

5.0	internal communication regarding delays in retail competition in texas october          the main purpose of this memo is to inform epmi and ees commercial teams regarding the implementation status of retail competition texas  particularly in non-ercot regions  which include parts of the areas served by the following utilities    southwestern electric power company  swepco  and west texas utilities company  wtu  - both in the spp region   entergy gulf states  egsi  - in the energy-serc region as most of you probably have heard  the texas utility commission has been examining  in the last few weeks  the readiness to implement retail competition in those areas  the public utility commission of texas  staff  has filed petitions seeking a determination of whether market institutions are ready for retail competition in above areas  to start january           there is a concern among the commission and many other participants that non-ercot-texas regions are not ready for competition  this concern has two major causes  - lack of a vibrant  efficient wholesale market in those regions  where newly established reps could have full access to others suppliers  on a non-discriminatory basis - lack of success in the retail pilot programs developed in      - no alternative suppliers and no customer shifting at all  a recent hearing has confirmed most reps absolute lack of interest in those regions - at least for the time being spp last week  the public utility commission decided to delay competition in spp texas  or  more accurately  "to delay customer choice"  in the commission preferred language  enron  who was requested to file a testimony  opposed to any delays  under the argument that spp is not a "perfect market"  but reps could trade in this market as other marketers do  no final dates have been established yet  however  one estimates that the delay may vary from    to    months  the commission has established some clear actions and milestones before retail competition is implemented  - support spp to begin wholesale market operations  which involves refinements and upgrades in a few of existing systems  such as settlement  - reform in spp tariffs and implementation of a market based congestion management  - continue the pilot  attract new competitors and open the market  as part of this effort  the commission created a southwest power pool market readiness implementation project  docket          to develop the necessary steps to transition to full competition  identify milestones  monitor progress and report to the commission on a regular basis  enron will be supporting this effort  serc serc regions bear resemblance with spp  in terms of commission's intent to delay competition  the most important difference is that the incumbent utility  egsi  an entergy subsidiary  has strongly supported timely implementation  the commission fears that entergy will benefit from its "monopolistic" position in the region  in the absence of other reps  no final decisions have been made yet  entergy gulf states  in conjunction with the commission staff and other interested parties have gone through a settlement process  whereby retail competition will be delayed until september           the subject is still being examined by the commission and no final decisions have been made  however  we expect the commission to approve the settlement agreement  therefore delaying competition until september           ercot all the discussion about delays in competition focuses on non-ercot texas only  there are rumors and ongoing discussions about delaying competition in ercot-texas  which is scheduled to take place on january           for example  nancy hetrich from enron  will be attending the legislative oversight committee on friday  november     she will be appearing in her capacity of chair of rms sub-committee  contrary to non-ercot  there is a strong support from most industry participants to have retail competition on time  besides  the results from the pilots were successful and ercot is supposed to provide vibrant wholesale competition  therefore  unlike spp and entergy  there should be no material reasons or fears to delay retail competition in ercot-texas  we will keep you apprised as things evolve

write-off of assets  revised do  wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $    billion redu  ction in shareholder equity  the problems have been due largely to dealings enron had with private partn  erships  run by some of its own executives  under investigation by the secu  rities and exchange commission  in an sec filing monday  enron disclosed hu  ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib  ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t  han $  billion in loans by the end of the year     as of   p m  wednesday in

the   volume of any other big board stock  enron's bonds also again traded sharpl  y lower  market observers said     the turmoil spilled over to dynegy's stock  which also was among the most a  ctively traded on the new york stock exchange  as of   p m  wednesday  dyne  gy shares fell $     to $      each     on wednesday  dynegy issued a statement in which chairman and chief executi  ve chuck watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory   approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously  announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on enr  on     under the merger agreement  dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk  away from the deal if enron's financial and legal problems become severe e  nough  however  some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-  called material adverse change clauses  they point to a decision earlier th  is year by a delaware chancery court judge who forced tyson foods inc  to c  omplete a planned purchase of ibp inc  even though tyson  a springdale  ark     food-products company  had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a  drop in ibp's earnings and accounting problems at an ibp unit     dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment  to complete the deal   two-thirds of dynegy shareholders and a majority of enron shareholders wou  ld have to give their approval  no dates for those votes have been set     one person familiar with the merger plans said the sec filing monday by enr  on contained information dynegy hadn't known about  dynegy representatives   planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i  nformation as part of the company's due diligence  this person said  it cou  ldn't be determined what the new information was     the merger agreement  announced nov     calls for dynegy to exchange         share for each of enron's roughly     million fully diluted shares  giving  the purchase a value of about $  billion at dynegy's current stock price    however  from a price standpoint  the deal is appearing less attractive to   dynegy     on the day of the merger announcement  enron shares were trading at about $       each  or about     of the purchase price under the exchange ratio  as   of wednesday  enron's market price was only about     of the merger-formula  price  such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme  nt  when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra  ding relatively close to the offering price     sentiment among wall street analysts also is turning against the merger  in  itially  many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue enron   and provide a major boost to houston-based dynegy  dynegy and enron officia  ls have predicted that the merger  supposed to be completed late next year   would significantly and immediately increase dynegy's earnings     now analysts are challenging that assumption  ron barone  managing director  at ubs warburg llc  said he believes that because of enron's financial pro  blems  a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than  dynegy would have by itself  mr  barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"  is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about       dynegy share for each enron share     such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal  according  to one person familiar with the merger negotiations  dynegy reduced the ex  change formula at least once prior to the nov    announcement because of en  ron's rapidly sinking stock price  which at the beginning of this year was   above $   a share     in perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on wall street  go  ldman sachs analyst david fleischer lowered his ratings on enron and dynegy    a longtime enron fan  mr  fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha  t the merger would help dynegy's earnings and whether enron could "recover   the significant business that has been lost" in its giant energy-trading op  erations  "the enron machine continues to sputter " mr  fleischer wrote     some observers say that if dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren  egotiate the terms significantly  enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l  aw filing  without the dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba  nkers and customers  an enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible "  said ralph pellecchia  a senior director at fitch  a credit-ratings agency    on wednesday  fitch maintained its credit rating on enron at just one not  ch above noninvestment-grade  or "junk " status  but fitch also said it bel  ieved enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls"  in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations " contrib  uting to "liquidity pressures "    among the advisers enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir  m of weil  gotshal   manges  which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-  workout situations  asked about a possible bankruptcy filing  an enron spok  eswoman said the company expects the dynegy deal to go through and therefor  e doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger  since the m  erger announcement  enron chairman kenneth lay has said his company had alt  ernatives to the dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them  enron sa  id it made some progress improving its financial position  the company said  it reached a final agreement with units of j p  morgan chase   co  and cit  igroup inc  on the remaining $    million of a previously announced $  bill  ion in secured credit lines  enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym  ent of an existing $    million note to mid-december from next week  the sp  okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet  ed next month so that repayment wouldn't be required

and against the firm itself in the waste managem  ent case     now enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by ar  thur andersen  in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from  the company's reported profits in recent years  all of which raises the question  has arthur andersen become the black shee  p of the accounting industry     it is not an easy question to answer  and not everyone is willing to rush t  o judgment  ''if you want to attack andersen for enron  you need to know mo  re than we know '' arthur levitt  the former chairman of the securities and  exchange commission  said this week     but if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases  it  is materiality  in all three cases  andersen auditors spotted bad accounti  ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea  d     materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into  trouble  the idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things we  re gotten wrong  but they can add up     at enron  however  they did not add up to that much -- a total of $   milli  on over four years  the biggest restatement of enron profits concerns a rel  ated party that enron now says should have been consolidated  it is not cle  ar if andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time     to those who treasure the role of auditors  the humiliation of andersen is   painful  back in the     's  it was leonard spacek  andersen's managing par  tner  who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it  was not showing enough independence  his public prodding was crucial in ma  king the industry do a better job  two decades ago  when the issue on the t  able was pension accounting  andersen was the only major accounting firm to  break with clients and push for good rules     now andersen's backbone is open to question  it was evidence that senior pe  ople at andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from waste management that   led the s e c  to bring that suit  which the firm chose to settle without a  dmitting it had done anything wrong  the partner that the s e c  says looke  d the other way at sunbeam is fighting the accusations  and andersen says h  e acted properly     lynn turner  who was chief accountant of the s e c  at the time and is now   director of the center for quality financial reporting at colorado state un  iversity  says what is happening to andersen now is reminiscent of what hap  pened to coopers   lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s  eries of highly publicized blown audits     ''we got bludgeoned to death in the press '' he said  ''people did not even  want to see us at their doorsteps  it was brutal  but we deserved it  we h  ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls   '' by that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending  clients and not enough to good accounting     for andersen to avoid that fate  its relatively new chief executive  joseph  berardino  who declined to be interviewed for this column  will need to se  t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the   backbone that mr  spacek epitomized  and then he will have to convince the   public of that  copyright        dow jones   company

has dropped    percent this year  more th  an other banks' shares  the bank's stock is ahead of investment banks like   goldman sachs  with which j  p  morgan chase increasingly competes     ''the jury is still out in many respects on this merger '' said judah kraus  haar  an analyst at merrill lynch  nevertheless  he likes j  p  morgan chas  e's stock  he said  because ''expectations are very low ''    all j  p  morgan chase's competitors are suffering from the slowdown on wal  l street  but some  like citigroup  are better diversified and have greater  involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking  which is proving to be a st  rong moneymaker this year     nearly a third of j  p  morgan chase's revenues are consumer-oriented  by c  ontrast  its chief new york rival  citigroup  gets half its revenues from c  onsumer businesses     ''the timing of the merger was bad '' said steven wharton  a banking analys  t at loomis  sayles   company  which owns about a million j  p  morgan chas  e shares  ''there's no disputing that ''    actually  mr  harrison disputes it  ''i can't tell you how happy i am about  having done this merger '' he said in a recent interview  ''while there ar  e pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment  we have a  much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time ''    in mr  harrison's favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who hav  e worked together for a decade or more  few executives remain in the top sp  ots from the old j  p  morgan  instead  most major posts are filled by mana  gers who have worked with mr  harrison since his days at chemical bank  whe  re he spent most of his career  mr  harrison's team successfully gobbled up  manufacturers hanover bank in       then followed that with chemical's mer  ger with chase manhattan in      before incorporating morgan into the fold   last year     the group of chemical veterans includes marc j  shapiro  who oversees finan  ce and risk management at j  p  morgan chase  donald h  layton  one of two   leaders of investment banking  and james b  lee jr   the bank's senior deal  maker  the team also includes dina dublon  the bank's chief financial offi  cer     two other senior executives have also lived through big deals  geoffrey t    boisi  the other investment banking leader  was the one-time investment ban  king chief at goldman  sachs  david a  coulter  in charge of chase's retail  bank  had been chief executive of bank of america before it was bought by   nationsbank     ''there aren't many teams that have gone through as many mergers as bill ha  rrison and his team '' said mark g  solow  managing principal at garmark ad  visors  an investment firm  and a former senior executive at chemical     still  ms  dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the j  p    morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations     ''in general  mergers are very hard on morale '' she said  ''there is no qu  estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll ''    the bank's executives are making the best of a bad situation  they have tak  en advantage of the slowdown to cut around   percent of the combined banks'  staff  or about       more employees than anticipated at the time the merg  er was announced     many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers  j  p  mo  rgan chase expects that       jobs in its investment banking division will   have been eliminated by the end of the year     ''we have focused on the tougher jobs to cut '' ms  dublon said     in some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for j  p  morgan  chase to overhaul its staff  with fewer jobs available on wall street  mr   shapiro said  the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a  bout changes in their jobs  ''people have fewer options '' he said  ''so yo  u have a little more control over the process ''    thanks partly to these cuts  the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin  g will be $    billion annually  compared with an original projection of $   billion at the time of the merger     the cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits  in the bank's core businesses  ''what we can control and are managing very  aggressively is the expenses of the company '' ms  dublon said in a confer  ence call with reporters on oct      the day earnings were announced     aside from cost cuts  the weakness on wall street makes it hard for the ban  k's executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking  where fees  were down    percent in the third quarter  but mr  harrison points to mark  et-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on wall   street  he hopes that when the investment banking business revives  j  p  m  organ chase will hold on to these gains     the bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas  mergers and ac  quisitions  and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals     the bank ranked  th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising  on mergers during the first nine months of       up from chase's   th-plac  e finish and j  p  morgan's   th-place standing during the same period last  year  according to thomson financial securities data     the merger and acquisitions business  which chase had been slowly building   for years  is stronger following the merger with j  p  morgan  said mr  lee    a vice chairman at the bank  as a result  the bank is able to win assignm  ents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old chase only for lo  ans     mr  lee remains proud of the bank's work with enron  the energy company  de  spite its troubles  j  p  morgan chase  along with citigroup  raised $  bil  lion in bank financing for enron earlier this month  it was also hired to a  dvise the company  which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove  r by dynegy     the old chase  long a lending powerhouse  would have had a good shot at lea  ding the bank financing  but an advisory role would have been less certain   mr  lee said the investment banker advising enron came from the old j  p    morgan  but with merger activity slow  there are few such deals to go aroun  d     the bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds   another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger   it moved up to second place in that area so far this year  compared with s  ixth place a year ago     the bank has taken advantage of a boom

momentum slowly in that business  ''we think we have a cha  nce in the second half of this year to be in the top five '' he said     given the slowdown  some bankers predict that mr  harrison will ultimately   do another deal  either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst  er weak areas in investment banking  like the equity division     ''the general view is that the combination with j  p  morgan didn't do enou  gh '' one investment banker said     mr  harrison disagrees  ''i don't feel '' he said  ''we need to do another   large deal to be successful '' photo  william b

make the energy t  rading business one to watch in       then came the california power crisis  and allegations of price-gouging and  fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group

chance for recovery in          basu mullick  portfolio manager of the neuberger berman partners fund  is w  illing to bet there is  he thinks energy traders deserve at least the same

were just recovering from gray davis " mullick said  referring to the  governor of california  who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of a  rtificially inflating the price of power in the state  and triggering the s  tate's energy crisis  "now  they are recovering from enron "    the fund manager also blames lower commodity prices  warm weather and poor   demand for the recent weak performance in the group     "energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates " he sai  d  "i don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut  ility "    still

the value of the position is realized over a longer pe  riod  the problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr  om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o  riginal assessment  also  sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair val  ue of the commodity position  this is particularly true in instances where   the market for the commodity isn't

quarter     patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based     "all things being equal  we believe reported earnings that more closely ref  lect the timely realization of cash have a higher

decision "    before sept      access was used only to trade energy futures at night  aft  er the day's nymex session had ended  use was limited to nymex members with  dedicated phone systems     the

eventually allow nymex to open up   trade to more users     the move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the sept       attack on the world trade center  nymex's building  located near where th  e trade towers stood  was shut down for several days after the attacks  exp  anding its already existent access system to the internet helped ease poten  tial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading  hours after nymex reopened     development of the enymex system began last year under the direction of for  mer nymex chairman daniel rappaport  in august  nymex said it would launch   the enymex platform within four to eight months  new nymex president j  rob  ert "bo" collins jr  said then that vendor problems had slowed development   of the system's front-end technology and caused the delays  but he still ex  pected enymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod  uct line     if nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as enyme  x with access  the new system may end up being known as enymex     "enymex right now is looking for a new mission " said an industry source cl  ose to nymex  "you know how politics works  we don't scrap it  we just rena  me it  anything we do electronically is now going to be called enymex  but   the original deal and concept that rappaport initiated is done "    nymex's reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid c  hange  the two most successful online energy trading platforms -- enron cor  p 's  ene  enrononline  and

enron shares and bonds fall on concern about takeover  update    updates with dynegy comment in fifth paragraph   houston  nov      bloomberg  -- enron corp  shares and bonds fell for a third day on concern the company's weakened financial condition and plunging stock price may lead dynegy inc  to try to cancel or rework a takeover of the biggest energy trader  shares of enron  the most-active u s  stock  dropped    cents  or   percent  to $      they fell    percent tuesday and wednesday after enron said it may have to pay more than $  billion in debt due by       enron     percent bonds due in july      were bid at    cents on the dollar  down from    cents on wednesday  traders said  enron shares are trading at less than half the value of dynegy's offer  which shows investors are questioning whether the buyout will be completed on the terms agreed to two weeks ago  enron's financial woes may prove to be a drag on dynegy's earnings next year if the transaction is completed  analysts said    there are continued doubts about the deal '' said ubs warburg analyst ronald barone  who rates dynegy a   strong buy'' and doesn't own shares in either company    enron's earnings aren't what they used to be because they've lost trading business  given that  dynegy has an opportunity to renegotiate the price '' dynegy spokesman john sousa said the company   remains optimistic for the potential of the merger '' enron agreed nov    to the takeover  now valued at about $   billion in stock and assumed debt  after a financial crisis threatened it with bankruptcy  on wednesday  enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $    million note due next week  giving the company more time to restructure its finances  dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson said he was   encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the note payment  as well as the closing of a $    million credit facility  and that dynegy remained committed to the purchase  more than    million enron shares changed hands today  almost twice their three-month daily average  in a session shortened because of the thanksgiving holiday  enron was the most-active u s  stock on wednesday  with     million shares traded  dynegy shares rose    cents to $      today  less than $  billion in a securities   exchange commission filing monday  enron said it has less than $  billion in cash and credit lines left  if the company's cash reserves run too low  enron is in danger of seeing its credit rating cut below investment grade  that would trigger $    billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships  enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors  including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies  in a bid to shore up the energy trader's finances with an injection of as much as $  billion  the new york times reported yesterday  citing unidentified executives close to the companies  enron spokeswoman karen denne said the company is seeking $    million to $  billion  enron needs to raise $  billion to $    billion in cash within the next    days  said sean egan  managing director of egan-jones rating co    their trading operation has burned through cash faster than the market had expected '' egan said  trading business traders including mirant corp  and aquila inc  have said they shifted transactions away from enron after its plunging stock price prompted concerns about creditworthiness  enron has said fourth-quarter earnings would be reduced partly by a drop in its energy-trading business  watson said after the enron buyout was announced he expected it to increase      earnings by    percent  analysts said that can't happen unless enron recovers lost trading business  several have cut their      estimates for enron  the average estimate of analysts polled by thomson financial first call for next year is now $     a share  down from $     a month ago  dynegy can cancel or renegotiate if enron can't meet debt payments  its trading market collapses  banks demand more collateral or raise the interest rate for loans  enron's credit rating is cut to junk  the sec cites enron for securities fraud  or if enron's legal liabilities including shareholder suits exceed $    billion  egan said  will dynegy renegotiate  dynegy officials were considering whether to try and renegotiate terms of its agreement with enron  according to the new york times report  dynegy and enron are both based in houston    dynegy investors would like to see the company negotiate a lower price for enron '' said credit lyonnais securities analyst gordon howald  who rates dynegy   buy'' and owns no shares  under the nov    terms  enron investors would receive        dynegy share for each share held  at today's closing price  that values enron stock at $       a year ago  enron traded at almost $    investors worry that a cancellation of the merger would push enron into bankruptcy    the market is saying there seems to be no obvious plan b for enron and that is what has investors concerned '' said eric bergson  who helps manage $  billion of fixed-income assets at northern trust co  in chicago    the lower bond prices go  what the market is saying is that there's less chance of this deal going through '' --jim polson in princeton           -     or jpolson bloomberg net kkr  blackstone are among likely enron investors  analyst

group are among the likely candidates to be approached by enron corp  for a private equity investment to shore up the company's balance sheet  said industry analyst david snow of privateequitycentral net  the firms have cash on hand and have invested in energy companies in the past  an investment in enron may look attractive now that its shares have plunged by    percent this year    many of the larger  more traditional buyout firms would find this deal attractive '' said snow    this is a company that has real assets that is down in the dumps and has need of capital when capital is scarce '' enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies to seek an investment  the new york times reported  citing executives close to the companies  enron's stock fell for a fifth day in six on concern the company's weakened financial condition may lead dynegy inc  to try to cancel or rework its planned purchase of the rival houston company  investors may inject as much as $  billion under arrangements that would protect them from further declines in enron's stock  the times said  the new investments would be in enron's transwestern pipeline  which connects natural-gas fields in texas to the california market  the newspaper said  j p  morgan chase   co  and citigroup inc  agreed to terms that give each of them a $    million equity stake as part of a transaction to be completed monday  officials told the newspaper  buyout firms sometimes make collective bids  pooling their money and distributing the risk  the firms also like to invest in industries that are out of favor with public investors and to do so in partnership with corporate investors  like dynegy  said snow    you need to know enough about the  energy  business to know whether it's a good deal  and then you need to be confident in the dynegy team '' he said  kkr kkr  the second-biggest private equity firm with $   billion in assets  declined comment on enron through spokeswoman molly morse of kekst   co  the new york-based firm invested more than $    billion in dpl inc   a utility in dayton  ohio  and will receive $    million of that back from the company after dpl sold $    million of bonds in august    kkr very much gets involved in deals where there's a corporate partner and they don't have a majority stake '' snow said    they would possibly hold it for years  because they like slow exits '' kkr is also a possible candidate because it recently raised a new $  billion buyout fund  any lbo firm would need assurance about how it will get its money back on an enron investment  said snow    the thing they have to be cautious about is the exit '' he said    if there's a chance dynegy would agree to buy out  the lbo firms'  stake over time  that would give some confidence  but if the only exit is the public market  that's a little bit dicier '' any private investment also must be large enough to make a meaningful difference  enron's market value is $    billion and dynegy has proposed paying $   billion in stock and assumption of debt  that means the private equity portion would have to approach $  billion or more  the    largest private equity firms have assets of more than $  billion under management each  according to asset alternatives  a wellesley  massachusetts industry research firm  still  many of those firms don't have enough free capital to undertake an investment of $    million or more  an announcement of an investment may come soon  analysts say  energy trading firms such as mirant corp  and aquila inc  are doing fewer trades with enron because of concern that the company won't be able to finance its business  enron shares have fallen by almost half in the past three sessions    they're going to need this investment within    to    days '' said sean egan of egan-jones ratings co    they're spiraling downward and they're going to need some more beyond the $    billion contributed by'' chevrontexaco corp   which

suit redmond  washington nov      bloomberg  -- microsoft corp 's plans to expand its msn high-speed internet service have been delayed by a lawsuit from enron corp   which could cost the company customers during the holiday season  analysts said  msn had planned to have fast internet access over telephone lines available  with help from energy trader enron  in    markets starting oct      instead  the service is now on sale in about    markets  said msn product manager lisa gurry  the latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that has delayed the rollout of microsoft's fast internet access service over the last year  the holidays are typically a popular time for customers to buy so-called broadband access  often along with new personal computers purchased or received as gifts    they have a track record of picking broadband partners that don't quite work out '' said joe laszlo  senior analyst at market researcher jupiter media metrix inc    it definitely hurts them with customers who want broadband right now '' subscribers to fast internet access services are expected to grow fourfold by       according to estimates by jupiter media metrix  while sales of slower internet access plans decline  fast internet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line  or dsl  technology  on track gurry said redmond  washington-based microsoft is still on track to have fast access for sale by the end of march to    percent of the    million to    million households that have dsl available in their neighborhoods    there is very little growth left in the dial-up access space for microsoft or anybody  which leaves them with broadband as the only potential growth area for the msn access business '' said youssef squali  an analyst at fac equities  who rates microsoft internet competitor aol time warner inc  a   buy '' microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music and video and software updates  which require fast internet access for smooth downloads  the company originally began a service with northpoint communications group inc   a now-bankrupt provider of fast web access  microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among cable companies who use their networks for high-speed service  now houston-based enron  which agreed in june to provide the backbone for a nationwide expansion of msn's service  is suing  enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn't required to deliver broadband services if microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to build  enron  which is being acquired by rival dynegy inc   recently disclosed debts of $     billion due by      and restated earnings for four years  slower expansion msn has been selling high-speed access in    states under partnership with qwest communications international inc  for the last few months  msn has begun the planned service expansion outside of those states by working with enron competitors that msn marketing director bob visse declined to name  the company is also talking to enron  he said  enron didn't return calls for comment  because of the enron suit the expansion is moving slower than expected  visse said  since oct      msn has added service in los angeles  san francisco  san diego and sacramento  california  and houston  dallas  san antonio and austin  texas  giving microsoft a total of about    markets rather than     plans to expand marketing are also on hold  visse said    it is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are in '' said microsoft chief executive steve ballmer  top u s  internet service provider america online  owned by aol time warner inc   has also been slow to get into the high- speed market  analysts said  that doesn't mean microsoft is in the clear  laszlo said both msn and aol might pay for their sluggishness with tougher competition from third-place earthlink inc  and from cable and telephone companies that have more experience selling high-speed internet access  america online has more than    million subscribers to msn's   million  earthlink inc  has      million subscribers  laszlo doesn't think msn or america online can build the kind of lead in the high-speed market that america online has in the slower dial- up access market   not a permanent blow' not that anyone need worry about microsoft  msn will be able to expand its fast internet access business even with the delays  laszlo said    they are already late in the broadband market so this means they get a little later '' he said    but broadband will continue to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a permanent blow '' analysts also say microsoft still needs to find a cable partner that will let msn use its network to sell fast access over cable lines  cable is more popular than dsl with customers looking for fast web service  the five largest cable providers control    percent of the u s  high-speed internet market  the five largest sellers of access via phone lines and dsl technology account for about    percent  according to market researcher ars inc  microsoft msn vice president yusuf mehdi said last month the company may be

5.0	jeff   john  we have drafted a note relating to the business operations of enron metals   limited  eml   as you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi  ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und  erstand the unique situation that eml has from a regulatory standpoint  aft  er your review  we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss  if you co  ncur with the actions suggested  please advise  if there is any balance sh  eet  debtor creditor or cash forecast information that you require  please   let us know  drew lynch  kevin heffron  jonathan marsh  and joe gold introduction enron metals limited  eml  maintains a unique position within enron corp    eml is one of enron's two businesses regulated by the uk financial service  s authority  fsa - the uk financial regulator  and enron's only remaining b  rokerage business  given its special status  eml has responsibilities to i  ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the fsa and the l  me  metals exchange  of which it is a member  as a result of this regulato  ry oversight  there are several differences between eml and enron's other b  usinesses       eml must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato  ry rules relating  among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus  iness  failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d  isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers       by virtue of its position as an lme broker  there are certain circumst  ances in which eml is regarded as acting as agent for its clients  eml's p  olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible  however  eml's cond  uct is evaluated by the fsa in light of the potential for that relationship  to exist  how eml conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th  e fsa and the lme       because the fsa has a duty to protect the orderliness of uk markets an  d to protect against systemic risk  eml's position as a provider of liquidi  ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la  ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the fsa and the lme  as a co  nsequence of this concern  the fsa requires regulated entities to maintain   prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi  tion and credit risk  the rules relating to regulatory capital require fsa   regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc  e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem  ent  these rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital  which can be   used by way of regulatory capital  and a breach of these rules is regarded   as extremely serious  an ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ  irement usually results in the fsa issuing an order requiring the firm to c  ease carrying on business       eml's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o  versight by the fsa and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for  a breach of the rules  penalties for individuals include significant fines  and possible expulsion from the industry  the duties owed by board members  under the fsa's rules are in addition to those owed under general uk law r  elating to directors' duties  directors overriding ring fencing obligation in the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem  onstrate to the fsa that  to the full extent possible  the financial streng  th of eml is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t  he rest of enron  in order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation   we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below  issues surrounding liquidity as we are all aware over the past week  as a result of the reputation probl  ems the corporation has been faced with  we have substantially increased th  e hands on financial and managerial oversight of eml  this was a precautio  n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for eml  clearly the   goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing   of eml was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t  he non-eml related problems of enron  this of course needed to be accompli  shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated enron comp  any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was  concerned     the fsa does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains  and distributes its cash  in the event  that cash is lent outside of eml   it must be collateralised by an lc in order to preserve the regulatory cap  ital of the firm  however  the firm has a number of options to preserve its  day to day liquidity         in its position as an lme broker  eml must have access to cash for two purp  oses  first  it must be able to post margin to the london clearing house    lch   in the event that liquidity ever prevented eml from posting collater  al to the lch  it would be in breach of the lch rules and regulatory enforc  ement action could ensue  in addition it would be declared a defaulter and   the lch would have the right to close out all of its positions  second  it  must be able to post margin to its clients  a failure to make a contractu  al payment to a client would likely result in fsa action if it were referre  d to the fsa  a third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-  money clients in the event that they wish to close their account  while th  ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr  ofits  the failure of eml to make such payment would cause reputation quest  ions  previously  we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari  os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity  however ce  rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to   fruition and the amount of cash maintained by eml and its ring fencing from  the rest of enron has become a concern  eml has or is in the process of l  osing $           of unsecured lc's  which were primarily used in lieu of c  ash at the lch  eml has had to use its cash to replace or secure those lc'  s  additionally  a number of clients have requested that their accounts be  transferred  those transfers have reduced eml's cash balance  was the re  maining $   mm unsecured lc  which has been issued by a single bank  to be   withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid  ity impact  the work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo  r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality  therefore we have   agreed to start to do the following a    change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid  ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t  he rest of the enterprise b    improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control  as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of eml personnel c    manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints  of continuing to do business on a normal basis d    obtain financial information on a much more timely basis e    periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a  s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity f     undertake to formalize arrangements with emgl for provision of additi  onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou  r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis operational risk     in theory  eml could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account  s and rely on enron corp  for the remaining portion of its day to day cash   needs  eml's board have been resistant to this practice for several very p  ractical reasons  first  it is possible that the lch could unexpectedly ca  ll on eml to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis  i  f eml relied on enron corp 's daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs    it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at corp  or an acco  unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either  capital or liquidity events as eml's clearing account at citibank would be  substantially overdrawn  given the likelihood that an lch or fsa event mi  ght create a cascade for enron  eml's board is reluctant to put that much f  aith in the      accuracy of our operational safeguards  capital as noted above  eml is subject to the fsa's regulatory capital rules and mu  st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis  the fsa requires th  at eml notify it if its capital base is less than      of the minimum finan  cial resources requirement  for a variety of reasons  there were occasions  when eml violated the      threshold on occasions in       because these v  iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the fsa did not take enfo  rcement action and eml instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain  s financial resources in excess of      so that it has a sufficient buffer   not to trigger the fsa notification requirement  in the current climate the  fsa has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari  se from enron's perceived financial weakness  accordingly  if one of those   violations occurred today  the fsa would likely commence a formal investiga  tion of eml and could issue an order requiring eml to cease trading in ligh  t of the need to reassure the fsa and in light of the sizable changes in em  l's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily   basis  eml's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev  el of       clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces  s capital adequacy go hand in hand      liquidity and capital adequacy stress testing the stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce  narios  which would cause liquidity issues for eml      changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte  rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral  rather than cash resulting in eml financing these losses at the lch      changes in market prices causing additional losses by the eml house ac  count resulting in eml financing these losses at the lch      clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other lme   brokers      withdrawal of lch letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i  nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca  sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the lch directly         credit exposures leading to credit losses recommendations the result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following  changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov  erall operational liquidity      to fully draw down the remaining $   mm available under the $    mm s  ubordinated facility      to monetize the inter-company marked to market positions   $   mm       to increase the subordinated facility to $    mm and extend the maturi  ty by six months to july           to monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi  ts and other assets held by eml      to stop providing credit for in house enron counterparts and to switch  to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol  d for calling margin      to stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients  other th  an a select group of key relationship clients         to continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c  ompanies  emcl and emcc  therefore shifting the need for inventory finance current situation unsecured guaranty         $   mm

21.0	ken and jeff  glen darden  the president and ceo of quicksilver resources  inc   is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine  recently  he has asked whether i would consider serving as an outside director on the board of directors of quicksilver  before meeting with glen to discuss this further  i want to make sure that enron does not have any objections  headquartered in fort worth  texas  quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties  quicksilver began trading publicly in march of      on the american stock exchange  kwk   quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with enron  enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today  enron  via jedi  also provided some financing at the time of the merger of quicksilver and mercury exploration and was a significant shareholder of quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering  i believe jedi has since divested this stockholding  if i were to serve on the board of quicksilver  i expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which i would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board  however  i do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as quicksilver's core business is complementary to enron  not competitive with enron  as a personal matter  it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry  i am scheduled to meet with glen and others at quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility  would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position  please do not hesitate to call me  x       if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further  thanks  jim hughes

21.0	hi kenneth  we are within a year anniversary attempt to arrange a meeting with you and our ceo jack nester in order to present telecompression  and how we can cut "enron corp " by hundreds of millions off long distance phone bill  the second part of this email is to show how we are advancing toward this "goal" and asking to allow us this meeting or a conference call with you  telecompression technologies announces intratel  groundbreaking new   -  telecompression software that dramatically reduces intra-office long-distance phone bills  intratel  a revolutionary new   -to-  voice compression software solution that could shave millions of dollars off corporate long-distance telephone bills  has just been announced by telecompression technologies  inc   tti  california  intratel  converts a company's lan  wan  intranet or vpn into the most advanced telephony communications system ever available  "for large corporations with multiple offices  campuses  including offices abroad  "this is the communications technology breakthrough everyone's been waiting for  it's easily the most significant cost-savings telecommunications tool of the past    years " intratel  is unique because of its dynamic bandwidth allocation and an unparalleled capacity of providing toll quality voice with up to   -to-  voice compression  it outpaces standard code compressions that can  at best  deliver voice at an  -to-  compression  this makes possible a level of compression  which tti has trademarked as telecompression  applicable across corporate enterprise networks regardless of bandwidth  "we can do all of this without sacrificing voice quality " intratel  which quickly installs on a windows      network  allows companies to immediately realize savings of thousands of dollars every month for calls to dispersed company facilities and their surrounding area codes  "for very large corporations with staffs and facilities all over the world  savings could easily run into the millions of dollars every year " intratel replaces a company's standard telephone communications with network-based pcs on any type of digital network  the company installs the intratel server software on one or more network domain controllers or dedicated windows      workstations  and individual users can easily download the intratel client software from the network  this gives each intra-company pc user  regardless of his or her global location  access to the program's unique cost-saving benefits and features  the program makes possible extremely high-quality pc-to-pc  pc-to-phone and phone-to-pc connections  it supports   baset     baset  and     baset  as well as optical-based networks  pbx features are included to facilitate user transition from conventional telco-type systems to network-based telephony operations  intratel can support up to        users over a wide area intranet or vpn comprised of either copper  fiber  satellite  wireless or combined system  other features include phone conferencing for up to eight individuals in multiple locations  whiteboard chat  optional voice mail lobby  text chat  file transfer and save-to-file  and more  among the many options are intratel phone jump  which lets any user dial any phone number in an area code in which the company has both an intratel access server and a connected employee user  in other words  if your san francisco office has an employee in london with the intratel server and pc software in place  you could call any other phone number in that london area code without paying long-distance phone charges  the new intratel encryption option  this solution gives businesses low-cost capabilities for protecting their worldwide telecommunications  intratel encryption provides the highest level of secure voice  text and data transfer with channel-by-channel encryption  each company receives and manages its own custom key store  giving it maximum security for sensitive communications "
6.0	i agree with lindy  i don't believe we want to mention anything about "shipper imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this  in instances where socalgas happens to issue an operational flow order  "ofo"  during the intraday   cycle  it can create imbalances with transwesterns customers  because it does not afford transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties  when an ofo is issued in the intraday   cycle  an allocation is passed on to transwestern through the confirmation process with socalgas  due to the timing of these ofo's  transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with transwestern's upstream parties  if you have further questions  please give me a call  thank you  terry kowalke

6.0	i agree on the nature of our statement and that a prompt action could avoid another source of dispute in the credit derivatives world  ----- original message ----- from   genova diane jpmorgan com  to   rpickel isda org  cc   board isda org    ksumme isda org    lmarshall isda org  sent  wednesday  october               am subject  re  credit derivatives issue     i think we should issue a statement regarding the deliverability of the   railtrack convertible bonds  first  i do not think that plain vanilla   converts are "contingent " and therefore should be deliverable  second    i think we need to have clarity and certainty here so that this issue does   not become another cloud over the credit derivatives market  the   statement should simply be isda's view as to the meaning and intent of its   own document  we should probably wait until we have had the opportunity   to see a draft of the opinion to be issued by robin potts  qc   just to   make sure that the statement and his opinion are in agreement            rpickel isda org on                     am         to  board isda org   cc  ksumme isda org  lmarshall isda org   subject  credit derivatives issue       you should be aware that an issue is currently under extensive debate in   the   credit derivative area resulting from the insolvency of railtrack in the   uk    isda has been asked by some participants in the market to make a statement   regarding a provision of its credit derivatives definitions  others are   either still considering their position or would prefer that isda not issue   a statement      specifically  the discussion relates to the deliverability of convertible   bonds of railtrack  there is no dispute that a credit event occurred  what   is in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of "not   contingent" under the definitions  which is a characteristic typically   required of deliverable obligations  this characteristic requires that the   payment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to a   contingency  the bonds are convertible into equity of railtrack at the   option of the holder or  in certain limited circumstances  at the option of   the trustee for the bondholder  the provision for the trustee to exercise   the conversion  sometimes referred to as a "widows and orphans" clause  is   a   standard clause in bonds issued in england and is intended to protect   bondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their conversion   right when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do so    in   the case of railtrack  conversion would not have been economically   beneficial at any time recently  but nevertheless the right of the trustee   to convert exists      a draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the credit   derivatives market practice committee  which i have attached for your   review  the statement refers to two documents that are in draft form  the   user's guide to the definitions  which is scheduled to be published in the   next week or two  and a supplement currently under consideration by the   "group of six" subgroup of the committee  in each of these documents  we   suggest that "plain vanilla" convertible bonds should satisfy the "not   contingent" characteristic and should  therefore  be deliverable  "plain   vanilla" convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where conversion   is at the option of the holder of the trustee      a meeting of a number of dealers based in london  not an isda meeting  is   scheduled for tuesday  it is not likely that we will publish anything prior   to that meeting      i would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any statement   regarding this situation  we are continuing to poll members for their views   on whether this type of market statement would be appropriate  we are also   discussing with allen   overy and with clifford chance and linklaters how   we   might achieve a legal basis for making the statement  please share your   views with the other addressees of this email  as they are coordinating the   views of members      bob               this communication is for informational purposes only  it is not intended as   an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of any financial instrument   or as an official confirmation of any transaction  all market prices  data   and other information are not warranted as to completeness or accuracy and   are subject to change without notice  any comments or statements made herein   do not necessarily reflect those of j p  morgan chase   co   its   subsidiaries and affiliates

9.0	dear mr lay  i write to you as chairman and chief executive officer of the enron corporation because i would like you to know that i am on my second period of sick leave in a year due to work related stress  a year ago i was apologised to by the human resources department and told that they would not allow it to happen again  through constant pressure and the unfair way in which i have been treated  the advice of my doctor and counsellor  as they are concerned with my health  was to accept the voluntary redundancy which had been offered to my colleagues and myself recently  though due to my exceptional circumstances i wrote the attached letter  today i received the attached response and i feel totally devastated that enron europe will not compensate me fairly for how they have affected my life and that of my family's  i read in enron's literature that you care about your employees and their families  and feel that your code of ethics should have offered me protection against the circumstances that i find myself in  but to my complete and utter dismay i find this is not the case and in my experience i have suffered a great deal and this seems to have been totally ignored in the response letter  i haven't once been contacted by enron europe to see how i'm coping and give me any support whatsoever  they are showing no care or concern for me or my family  i write to you for help in this matter and to conclude this stressful situation that i find myself in due to your company  under the circumstances and increased stress that the response letter has put upon me  i would be most grateful if you would respond to me as soon as possible

6.0	jordan      yes to section     any and all filings required by the '   act ---  -qs    -ks   -ks    ds  form  s  pursuant to section     etc  any and all '   act filings by enron corp  are available at the sec's website----that is the fastest and most efficient way to access them      sec file number  enron corp - -           total assets and liabilities  i would use our latest   -q filed last week  however  as we all know  these are not only unaudited  we do not have the aa sas    letter  limited review letter required for quarterly financials   perhaps we should consult causey as to the answer to this question  although my best guess would be the third quarter financial statements just filed with the sec      debt securities and number of holders---i would have no way of knowing this---i would check with corporate treasury  tim despain  clint freeland and the folks in their group   the group responsible for paying the interest on our debt securities would know the answer to this  and that would be corporate treasury  as to number of holders  they may have to contact the trustee of the debt securities  for most of the public debt securities  i believe that would be bank of new york  as successor trustee to harris trust  enron's long-time trustee      number of shares of preferred stock ---i thought this list was included in the schedules to the merger agreement  but i can't seem to put my hands on the schedules  i will try to get this list to you today or early in the morning  sunday   brenda funk may also have an up-to-date list  the recent preferred stock issuances relate to structured financings  which are deals i don't work on---that's the reason i don't have this info at my fingertips---but i think i can get it for you  tomorrow morning  if not today       as of october     according to   -q filed last week              shares of common stock issued and outstanding  this does not include treasury shares---if we need that number  we will have to get from the corporate secretary's office       desciption of enron's business  i agree with you  we can lift this from the current   -q filed last week  anything before that may be out of date       look at the draft of the proxy statement that i sent to you yesterday  the reference to janus is as of february of this year---as you know  institutional holders of    or more only have to file an annual schedule   g  on on before feb     of each year   of course  other    or greater owners must file a   d shortly after acquiring their holdings  and i am not aware that we have received a schedule   d lately  the issuer is supposed to receive a copy  as well as the sec   mark koenig in investor relations might have a handle on who enron's current owners are  without a schedule   d  we can assume that no one else owns in excess of          with respect to enron corp  common and second preferred convertible stock  there are literally thousands of holders  i assume the only way to get this information is the shareholder lists from the transfer agent  or  possibly the corporate secretary's office would have this info---if not  they would be the group that knows how to get it        see no    above  jordan and julia  the information that we would need to get from enron's transfer agent or enron's trustees for its debt securities would not be available from those entities until monday  if we needed it before then  as noted above the best sources of information would be the enron treasury group  with respect to debt securities outstanding  and the corporate secretary's office  paula rieker and elaine overturf  with respect to shareholder lists  i apologize in advance that i will be necessarily out of pocket saturday afternoon  but plan to be in the office all day sunday if i can help with this  thanks  rex -----original message----- from  mintz  jordan sent  friday  november               pm to  rogers  rex cc  schuler  lance  legal  subject

total assets and total liabilities as of a specified date  should we use our q    -q filing of last week       debt securities held by more than     holders  indicate whether secured  unsecured or subordinated  amount of debt and approximate number of holders       number of shares of preferred stock and approximate number of holders         number of shares of common and approximate number of

11.0	many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week  especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today  we want to encourage you to come to work  we continue to consider every option available to us as a company  and unfortunately  restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options  your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process  i still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy  but you should be aware that  in general  the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within    days of a petition filing to the extent of $      per employee  i want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition  we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices  additionally  enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing  for enron  where our value is directly tied to our employees  making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority  we are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue  of course  until we finalize those business decisions  we cannot make that determination  i know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you  i can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so  while terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment  we hope to do what we can to assist them  we will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search  we have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in enron alumni  we will share more information on these efforts soon  i appreciate your continued patience and cooperation  ken

5.0	as you know  enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron  we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing  even though enron has entered into this agreement  u s  and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other  in particular  to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets  their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed  therefore  for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement  in addition  all information  documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller  lance schuler  robert eickenroht  mark haedicke  rob walls or greg whalley of enron  it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained  to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement  then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals  if you have any questions concerning this notice  please contact lance schuler         -       robert eickenroht         -       mark haedicke         -      or rob walls         -       thank you for your help in this matter

5.0	john  i found the error  it was a small logic error  you can easily fix the problem if you go into the visual basic editor for the blotter file  in the editor  you will see several modules listed on the left of the screen under the file  you will need to edit the "main query" module  once in the "main query" module  you will need to search for the routine named "verifymanualinputs"  the actual start of the routine looks like this  function verifymanualinputs fromdate as string  todate as string  putcall as string  lots as string  strike as string  price as string  cparty as string  stype as string  as boolean within this routine  about   -   lines down  you should see the following two lines   if  isdate fromdate  and isdate todate   then if  todate   fromdate  then you need to change the second line to   if  cdate todate    cdate fromdate   then this should fix the problem  the intent of the line is to prevent the "to date" of a deal from being earlier than the "from date"  in the original line of code  it does a text based compare  like comparing is "abc"   "def"  instead of comparing the two values as dates  the modification i've laid out converts the from and to dates to date values before comparing  i have tested the fix here and it should work fine  i hope everything runs smooth for you next week  have a good thanksgiving  greg

5.0	listened in on the analyst call this morning  here are my notes  did not yet have a chance to organize them  so they're simply in chronological order  the call began with watson  bergstrom  and whalley reading from prepared statements  watson spoke for c     minutes  bergstrom for    and whalley spoke for perhaps    seconds  dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call  enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them  specific points  ees will be a part of the new company  enron assets will be revalued at closing  the investment in northern natural takes the form of convertible preferred  if the merger does not go through  dynegy has the right to acquire northern for 'very little' additional consideration  if dyn terminates the merger and ene 'has sufficient liquidity'  ene has right to repurchase the convertible preferred  debt equity of combined company expected to be       both companies will remain on ratingswatch negative  chevrontexaco will hold    mm shares out of a total    mm shares of the post-merger entity  watson reiterates that going forward  the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure  with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage  in what was termed a "new approach"  the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings  rumors that dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to enron are not true  dynegy owed enron  $  mm  lay says that enron had other options  'particularly financial'  all of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks  lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big'  but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure  lay says we have nothing else to hide  but internal investigation still under way  lay  had the spes been capitalized with perhaps $  mm more of risk capital  there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the spes  dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at enron  and thus dyn ene cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there  doty  dynegy cfo  says that late last week  ene had 'close to a billion' in cash  osprey will be unwound late next summer  marlin will be unwound after closing  many of the off-balance-sheet structures  including the credit-linked notes  are expected to be unwound redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing  with regard to ene asset dispositions  these will be accelerated to the extent possible  however  doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall'  and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash  ene will renew its    -day facility  believe this is the $ bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago  within the next  -  weeks  bbb-flat most likely rating for combined entity  according to initial comments from ratings agencies  mcmahon says 'no comment' to wsj article indicating that ene's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ene in the next few weeks  consolidation of trading activity  mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing  such that only the front office   trading books will need to be combined at closing  ees  nng and tw have no real overlap with existing dyn activity  so there won't be much integration work required there  the big integration effort will be ena  watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets  doty adds that  'frankly'  dyn assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model  they bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets businesses and left it at that  watson mentions that dyn would not have gotten involved with enron had they not been approached by 'enron's top three executives'  who said that they thought a combination with dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies  says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with dyn to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger  watson doty said that they're not      sure that no surprises remain in enron's books--but that the risk reward offered by the combination was compelling  the deal does have material-adverse-change outs for dynegy  covering any mac regarding enron's assets or businesses  dynegy's lawyers indicated that the mac language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case  so dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the enron's total legal liability  from any source or cause of action  tops $   bn prior to closing  mcmahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements  but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements  ene international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list  the merger structure calls for a new entity to take over enron  enron is planning to hold an enron-specific conference call in the next few days  tentatively scheduled for wednesday  initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities  mcmahon acknowledges that enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end  had the merger not materialized  dynegy's earnings guidance places enron-related earnings accretion at $    -      which represents a '    haircut' to enron internal estimates  doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies  doty says that both enron and dynegy's books  as far as he understands  are relatively short-term in weight  and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity  says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash  chevrontexaco's investment in dynegy was calculated at a    discount to public prices on the date of negotiation  not disclosed   given the runup in dynegy stock last week  chevrontexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices  chevrontexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'   no further clarification given   whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the enron traders and marketers  they're used to being part of a winning team  and the combined entity will definitely be a winner  they have talked with most of the enron business leaders  and they are 'very excited' by the combination  they will be working with the enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained  whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions  he says that 'to the extent necessary  yes ' watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of dyn and ene--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus  but by the same token the new dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the dynegy of today  watson says that if there were to be any change in culture  he's a strong team player  he does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well  give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments

6.0	tim and steve  as mentioned by tim  another alternative would be to not make the prepetition payment and just use the market to settle these obligations  if the cost of the payment is factored into the cost of the transmission and compared to the cost of a market settlement  the company would benefit by not making the prepetition payment for approximately the next    days worth of deliveries  after this time the company would incur additional costs to deliver at pinnacle peak for the remaining term of the walc obligation  the term of the walc agreement is through          and is in the money during llh for the entire term 
19.0	today  we announced our third quarter earnings results  which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $      this marks a    percent increase over the third quarter of last year  which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines  in addition  we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $     for the fourth quarter  $     for       and $     for       we made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about enron's business strategy and performance  so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter  over the past few months  we have met with analysts to discuss enron's performance  we received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units  in response to that feedback  we have provided results separately for several of our business units  for example  while we have provided volume figures for north america and europe  this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for enron americas and for europe and other commodities  in addition  information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for wholesale services  this quarter they are reported separately  finally  even though our broadband business is now part of enron wholesale services  we are continuing to report that business separately  following are the highlights of our businesses  wholesale services  total income before interest  minority interests and taxes  ibit  increased     to $    million in the third quarter  total wholesale physical volumes increased     to      trillion british thermal units equivalent per day  tbtue d   americas  ibit increased     to $    million  natural gas volumes increased    to      tbtu d  and power volumes increased     to     million megawatt hours  mwh   europe and other commodity markets  ibit remained unchanged at $   million as compared to last year  while physical gas and power volumes increased  low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat  retail services  enron energy services reported ibit of $   million  compared to $   million a year ago  so far this year  ees has completed more than    transactions with large customers and more than        deals with small business customers  transportation and distribution  natural gas pipelines  ibit increased slightly to $   million in the third quarter  portland general  we reported an ibit loss of $     million this quarter compared to ibit of $   million a year ago  this loss is due to power contracts pge entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter  last week  we announced an agreement to sell pge to northwest natural  this transaction is expected to close next year  global assets  this segment includes elektro  dabhol  tgs  azurix and enron wind  third quarter ibit remained unchanged at $   million compared to last year  broadband services  ibit losses were $     million in the current quarter compared to a $     million loss last year  this quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs  corporate and other  this segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions  this segment reported an ibit loss of $     million compared to $      million a year ago  in addition  this quarter we announced one-time charges of $     billion  over the past few quarters  we have conducted a thorough review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core businesses  these charges include    a $    million write-down of azurix corp    $    million associated with the restructuring of broadband services  this includes severance costs  a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers  and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers    $    million related to losses from certain investments  primarily enron's interest in the new power company  broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement  with our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things     we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses     we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses  and    we expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors  to read the full earnings press release  go to www enron com corp pressroom releases

6.0	elizabeth  background  on wednesday  october     the npuc voted to authorize its general counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain spp np long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at ferc  according to the utilities  the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $    million  enclosed  you'll find         attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical enron-spp np deals that are     currently flowing or     scheduled for future delivery  i have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of spp np's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief  not refunds  i am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to spp and np  worst case  back of the envelope  we are looking at approximately $    million in mtm exposure for all deals  however  the prices under these deals range from $      mwh to $    mwh  the $     deal is for transmission   it's extremely unlikely that ferc would     void every transaction or     reduce the price for every deal to $   therefore  the true amount at risk is less than $    million  bottom line  all in all  i think the risk of ferc undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons     the alj in the pacific northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because     the non-california long-term market was competitive  and     because of the concern about "ripple" claims  although the commission has not yet adopted the alj's recommendation  i expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support     spp np is the only party arguing that the southwest market is uncompetitive  this aspect was fatal to the pacific northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds     spp np was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the california utilities  which were required to buy from the px  presumably  these were the lowest prices available at the time     if ferc voids or reprices these contracts  it will be pressured to do the same for california's dwr contracts  contracts collateral  these transactions are all under the wspp  we currently hold no collateral from spp np  tracy ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the wspp did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event  such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase  i advised her that the wspp standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's "financial viability" decreases  my view is that spp np's admission that it is $    million under water is  in itself  cause for a margin call  i am  however  sensitive to the fact that a margin call might     be perceived as "punishing" spp np for "trying to enforce the law " or     strengthen spp np's resolve to seek refunds  tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this  mitigation  i spoke with tim belden and tracy ngo about this on monday the   th  there is zero interest in trying to work with spp np on a blend extend  "why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money " there is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at ferc  ultimately  we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure  other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at ferc and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at ferc

14.0	as you know  enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron  we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing  even though enron has entered into this agreement  u s  and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other  in particular  to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets  their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed  therefore  for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement  in addition  all information  documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller  lance schuler  robert eickenroht  mark haedicke  rob walls or greg whalley of enron  it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained  to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement  then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals  if you have any questions concerning this notice  please contact lance schuler         -       robert eickenroht         -       mark haedicke         -      or rob walls         -       thank you for your help in this matter

 weeks  bbb-flat most likely rating for combined entity  according to initial comments from ratings agencies  mcmahon says 'no comment' to wsj article indicating that ene's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ene in the next few weeks  consolidation of trading activity  mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing  such that only the front office   trading books will need to be combined at closing  ees  nng and tw have no real overlap with existing dyn activity  so there won't be much integration work required there  the big integration effort will be ena  watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets  doty adds that  'frankly'  dyn assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model  they bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets businesses and left it at that  watson mentions that dyn would not have gotten involved with enron had they not been approached by 'enron's top three executives'  who said that they thought a combination with dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies  says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with dyn to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger  watson doty said that they're not      sure that no surprises remain in enron's books--but that the risk reward offered by the combination was compelling  the deal does have material-adverse-change outs for dynegy  covering any mac regarding enron's assets or businesses  dynegy's lawyers indicated that the mac language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case  so dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the enron's total legal liability  from any source or cause of action  tops $   bn prior to closing  mcmahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements  but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements  ene international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list  the merger structure calls for a new entity to take over enron  enron is planning to hold an enron-specific conference call in the next few days  tentatively scheduled for wednesday  initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities  mcmahon acknowledges that enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end  had the merger not materialized  dynegy's earnings guidance places enron-related earnings accretion at $    -      which represents a '    haircut' to enron internal estimates  doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies  doty says that both enron and dynegy's books  as far as he understands  are relatively short-term in weight  and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity  says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash  chevrontexaco's investment in dynegy was calculated at a    discount to public prices on the date of negotiation  not disclosed   given the runup in dynegy stock last week  chevrontexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices  chevrontexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'   no further clarification given   whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the enron traders and marketers  they're used to being part of a winning team  and the combined entity will definitely be a winner  they have talked with most of the enron business leaders  and they are 'very excited' by the combination  they will be working with the enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained  whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions  he says that 'to the extent necessary  yes ' watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of dyn and ene--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus  but by the same token the new dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the dynegy of today  watson says that if there were to be any change in culture  he's a strong team player  he does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well  give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments

6.0	pete  you weren't too late and john conveyed the message to roy reardon our mediator  i talked with john and the phone call with reardon turned out to be each side giving their story--king went first and took about    minutes which gardiner happily listened to  i'll let gardiner give you the details tomorrow  but the upshot was as follows  please sit down and resist punching the screen      shell came into the deal at $    with outside lending for     and only     equity  from nov      --mar      there was a dramatic budget increase that caused shell concern because the numbers didn't make sense     enron owes shell a fiduciary duty of full   frank disclosure  good faith  honesty     the turnkey contract with scc for a lump sum of $    "gave shell great comfort" because scc had to complete the project timely or pay delay damages     shell was not consulted about the increase from $    to $           go figure         what angered shell the most  was the manner in which we tried to impose the $    budget for their failure to object   while this could be true it is not a terribly sympathetic argument because the project companies needed money      shell believes scc should have to bear these costs     "shell will prove that the a r contract did not have shell's consent "         even though shell bought in  they were never treated properly as a partner in the project and were consistently excluded   calm down laine      now that gas is at the plant  the turbines are broken and we're not earning money  the turbines broke because we used the wrong fuel  "somebody left tools in gt   " and we "released siemens from their warranty "  never mind that it expired      the more of these ridiculous arguments they make  the better for us  so gardiner is going to encourage shell to go first  we'll discuss tomorrow  regards  michelle

19.0	i spoke with dale sanders at williams today  they seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way  regulatory filings  enviornmental and engineering work  i had previously put this project at a very low probablility  especially with the     mm d kern expansion in       i did not think that they would be able to get williams marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity  however  they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity  obviously that is the key to williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality  williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other         mmbtu d  i have to put that probability at still fairly low  but stranger things have happened  especially if williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the     mm d  probably the entire project is still less than     but it is obviously something to monitor very closely  if the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for cig and northwest  especially on the heels of the kern river expansion  in addition  the cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years  call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments

5.0	the alj submits her report to ferc to obtain ferc review of the southeast p  ower grid platform that resulted from the mediation            judge's final recommendations  ferc should consider adoption of grid mo  del  the one enron likes best  to fullest extent possible and that remainin  g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process  ho  wever  since complete consensus was not reached  ferc should provide its de  termination of which of the two models best meets ferc's expectations as a   platform for the se power grid rto  this should be done by ferc quickly    there should be no further delay  regardless of the model  ferc should enc  ourage the collaborative process  she thinks that this should be done by t  he parties without ferc intervention except to the extent to respond to fer  c orders   i think ferc staff should be involved or it will get bogged down     parties should reconvene within    days after ferc's order adopting a m  odel and the ferc order should direct the participants  like us  to submit   a joint proposal within    days thereafter  she recommends to ferc that pa  rties be allowed to file comments to ferc within    days  however  she reco  mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc  tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process   the commission  will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations  may reject he  r recommendations  or change something  i would expect that the commission  would adopt many of her recommendations  while allowing further mediated-t  ype discussions on some issues  hopefully  ferc will adopt many of our sugg  ested changes   judge mccartney then basically describes both proposals of  the grid group and the southern  etal  group  then provides the stakeholde  r participants' comments  almost verbatim from all submissions to her   wh  ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly  she does not ad  opt any timeframes  we will comment that ferc should retain its dec    day     start date  for lmp financial rights congestion model to be implemented       the attachments below are her report  the southern  etal proposal and the g  rid pricing  congestion management  operating  and planning protocols  with  out any changes   clearly  our response ferc will include our proposed cha  nges to the documents  highlights from her report below  she recommends that spp pursue an rto coalition in the midwest    she encourages ferc to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr  ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input  r  egardless of the rto platform ultimately adopted by ferc    her opinion is that the "grid  entergy  gridsouth and gridflorida utility s  ponsored  model"  transco in rto  lmp financial rights congestion managemen  t  is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements  of order no       based on a "best practices" analysis of other rtos and c  ommission precedent  this is good because enron generally favors the grid   model  however  she does provide the commission information on southern  et  al 's proposal  independent system administrator--like national grid-type    in her report  even though she has concerns that the southern  etal model i  s not order no       compliant  the southern  etal  model has a hybrid phy  sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a  nd lmp in real time  with penalties  and significant control area responsib  ilities  the significant aspects of the grid model are discussed below     grid governance  rto is a for profit transco with an independent board and   an enhancement  the independent market administrator  ima   the ima was a  dded to facilitate public power participation  worried that transmission ow  ner on top  even if divested from generation  would favor its transmission   solutions over generation or other transmission

their control  areas for physical operation  such as switching transmission elements  pur  suant to operating procedures approved by the rto ima  recognizes that con  solidation of control areas may

of our comments from last week's response are included     judge mccartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners      many a  re still concerned that ferc had not conducted a "cost-benefit" analysis an  d had concerns over the costs  she responds that extrapolation of costs to  the entire se rto seems unwarranted because it ignores the "economies of s  cale" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure    in any event  ferc could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process  that would involve the state commissions      concerned about cost shiftin  g  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the commission has allo  wed      concern that se rto would preempt state ability to approve asset t  ransfers to rto and want state retail customers to receive full value for a  ssets      concern that se rto may prematurely put southern states into re  tail open access  concerns with cal   judge encourages the commission to u  tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners    i think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the   extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant "jump sta  rt" it gave to the se rto process due to the significant role played by jud  ge mccartney and her team on focusing the discussions  furthermore  the in  itial results after    days show the majority of participants favoring a "b  est practices" pjm spp cornerstone type real time spot energy market with l  mp pricing and financial congestion hedges and an rto with an independent b  oard structure that accommodates a for-profit rto entity with a significant  stakeholder advisory process  the commission should consider utilize the   fundamentals resulting from this

14.0	today  we announced plans to merge with dynegy  a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties  dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own  we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build  following are the major components of the transaction  deal terms -- the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of        dynegy shares for every enron share  for example  each       shares of enron stock will be converted to     shares of dynegy upon closing  plus cash for fractional shares  upon closing  -- chevrontexaco owns approximately    percent of dynegy's outstanding common stock  chevrontexaco will invest $    billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $  billion in dynegy on closing of the merger  dynegy will immediately invest $    billion in cash in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas  -- total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately     million shares  -- the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  and is expected to close late next year  enron will have immediate access to dynegy's $    billion cash investment in enron's northern natural gas subsidiary  management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company  which will be called dynegy inc   and steve bergstrom will be president and coo  i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes  i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman  greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes  then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman  mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron  management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth  efficient integration  the make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined  the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter       this merger will create an enormous growth engine  providing great opportunities for our employees  shareholders and customers  as with any merger  some elimination of positions is almost inevitable  and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company  we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions  clearly  we cannot rule out involuntary separation  but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations  i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible  as i said in my video  this is a day like no other in our company's history  we considered several options  but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence  strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses  i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps  we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at  http   home enron com updates    if you have additional questions  please submit them to questions enron com  mailto questions enron com   we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions  if you receive any calls from the media  please refer them to our media team at          -

6.0	steve kean and i believe quite strongly  within a four peer group structure  that we need to allocate somewhere between    and    percent of gov't   public affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the gov't public affairs groups who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and direct impact on commercial activities  net income  these individuals should be moved to specialized technical     and others who are performing a less strategic function  who should remain in the commercial support category   with that said  it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for mid-year prc purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved  for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt   if we stay with the four group stucture  i intend to push hard for the remapping of gov't affairs by year-end  on a completely seperate issue  i continue to be very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups i'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- i just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there     the concern  simply stated  is that it may be entirely counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at enron  particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high   and that is even before you begin to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour  thanks

9.0	for the first time in    years of service for enron i'm ashamed to admit th  at i work for enron  i have lost all respect for enron senior management a  nd agree with the financial analyst when they say that enron senior managem  ent can not be trusted  ethics and morals are either something everyone el  se needs to have except senior management or somewhere along the way senior  management started believing the end justifies the means  the communicati  on the employee's have received over the last few years about values such a  s respect  integrity  communication and excellence must be propaganda inten  ded to get employee's to believe senior management really supported these v  alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som  ething just the opposite  i can not believe that senior management lacks the understanding of human n  ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha  ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in  the future  then to allow an enron spokesperson to speak for enron with t  he statement "it's just a balance-sheet issue" implies to me that this ind  ividual does not know what a balance sheet or income statement is and certa  inly should not be speaking to the public  if you are going to play the ga  me of lying  cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen  t a plausible story  to use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua  ting values in some of enron's broadband telecommunications and other techn  ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini  tion of the word "hedge"  a hedge by definition implies that the upside an  d downside exposure has been limited  it frightens me that we are out aski  ng customers to let enron help them "hedge" their risk when i'm not sure en  ron's senior management understands what a hedge means  i'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of andy fastow i  n the investment vehicle that generated this write down  i must be confuse  d in that as a trader enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that i  will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the  natural gas business  this must be an example of as my father used to say  " do as i say not as i do"  i guess we need to have audits performed of se  nior managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as   their word  the fact that senior management and the ene board of directors knew these t  ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and   took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ene stock options in my opin  ion is "criminal"  it provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp  etrators of this fraud have left enron in recent months  these individuals  have stolen billions of dollars from ene stockholders and employees and ne  ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity  they are set for life  h  aving all the money they could ever need  while employees and stockholders   have lost their life savings  you have completely failed at the job you we  re hired to perform  if this type of activity would have occurred farther   down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve  d and to institute criminal charges      i for one can not wait until the all employee meeting next week  i do not   think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we  trust what is said anyway  instead i feel you owe the ene employee's a th  orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities  what  actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor  mance to date

n't worth even half what dynegy has offered to pay  analysts and investors   are paying close attention to the circumstances under which dynegy could ba  rgain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal     earlier this month  houston-based dynegy offered to buy its far larger cros  s-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values enron shares at $        apiece  or a total of about $    billion  but in the wake of post-agree  ment disclosures by enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan  tially less than expected  the company's stock has been hammered  in   p m   trading on the new york stock exchange on friday  enron shares fell    cen  ts to $      the stock is down     so far this year and far short of the pe  r-share takeover price  dynegy shares rose    cents to $       although dynegy and enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under  the terms negotiated  dynegy does appear to have other options  the agreem  ent with enron contains a broad "material adverse change" clause as well as  some specific trigger points that could be invoked     dynegy officials performed "due diligence" throughout the holiday weekend    seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of enron  which has suffe  red a series of damaging blows  since mid-october  enron has disclosed that  some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved  assets off enron's balance sheet  for a time  to several private partnersh  ips  those deals are now the subject of a securities and exchange commissio  n investigation  past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an "  accounting error" by enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since o  ct      at one point  enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning  s     an enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the  deal would be completed as agreed  dynegy spokesman john sousa said the tw  o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi  sions "are broad  by design  to ensure adequate protection for dynegy share  holders " shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen  t     clauses related to a "material adverse change " also known as a "material a  dverse effect " have been the focus of much attention among merger professi  onals this year  due  in part  to the stock market's fluctuations and the e  conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi  tions     but such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c  onsidered extremely difficult to prove  both parties typically are reluctan  t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal  much the way a bride and   groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to   envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins     furthermore  a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t  hat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger  in that case  meat-proces  sing concern tyson foods inc  sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea  t-packer ibp inc  due to a drop in ibp's earnings and a write-down of an ib

opinion  delaware chancery court vice chancellor leo e    strine jr  wrote that "       the important thing is whether the company   has suffered a material adverse effect in its business or results of operat  ions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia  lly reasonable period  which one would think would be measured in years rat  her than months "    that interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community  promp  ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh  ich deals can be terminated  since the sept     attacks  for example  a han  dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou  ld qualify as a "material adverse change " or mac     a key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change   is "whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is  it just a hiccup " says meredith brown  co-chairman of the mergers and acq  uisitions group at law firm debevoise   plimpton in new york  he adds that   a court "may be skeptical" if dynegy claimed that enron's post-merger agree  ment disclosures were a surprise     the enron-dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith  er side to seek termination  enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst  antially better offer  although it is prohibited from soliciting one  in su  ch a case  it could be required to pay a $    million "topper fee" to dyneg  y and its co-investor  chevrontexaco inc     dynegy can alter the deal if enron faces "pending or threatened" litigation  liabilities that are "reasonably likely" to cost enron $  billion  if thos  e liabilities hit $    billion "an enron material event will be deemed to h  ave occurred " presumably allowing dynegy to call the whole thing off  in s  ome situations  dynegy would be liable for a $    million fee  as well     karen denne  the enron spokeswoman  said her firm doesn't believe that loss  es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e  vent  the liability must result from litigation  currently  the company fac  es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by  officers and directors  issuing false and misleading reports and other off  enses     deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in en  ron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself   give dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force enron to renegotiate it  s terms  instead  they say  dynegy would likely have to prove that enron's   worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event  which could be di  fficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and dynegy's f  requent statement that it clearly understands enron's businesses  still  th  ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow dyne  gy to terminate the deal if "any representation or warranty of enron shall   have become untrue "    other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto  ck prices that changed an acquisition premium  western

oct     and called enron chairman  c  eo  and longtime acquaintance kenneth l  lay to ask how he could help  lay   didn't respond immediately  but as enron's stock continued to plunge and th  e company faced a cash squeeze  it became clear what the only realistic ans  wer could be  bail us out  so two days later  lay invited watson to his river oaks home near downtown   houston for breakfast to discuss a deal  over muffins and   a bad cup of co  ffee'' the next day  watson recalls  they sketched the outlines  and by      p m  that night  the investment bankers were called in  on nov

thought it   was ''    but the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by enron's accounting  tricks  the biggest danger for watson is that there are other time bombs t  icking away  already  the company has slashed its reported earnings since        by $    million  or     of its total  to account for controversial part  nerships involving enron officials  the securities   exchange

after y  ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to     a year    the houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t  hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars  it  was confirmation of investors' worst fears  three weeks earlier  enron had  announced a big drop in shareholders' equity  sparking fears that its hide  ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance  ma  nagement pointed to a number of factors  including a dubious decision to ex  clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a  billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's  net worth     enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho  rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases  b  ut it is hardly alone  this year  corporate america is expected to charge o  ff a record $    billion  much of it for assets

former chairman of the federal reserve and now one of   the leaders of the international accounting standards board     sometimes  as in the case of enron  fuzzy numbers result from questionable   decisions in figuring net earnings  more often  though  the earnings chaos   results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the  ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an  d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies  which appear under a variet  y of names  from   pro forma'' to   core ''  enron offers its own such vers  ion  before investors untangled the importance of enron's first announcemen  t  its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its   recurring ne  t income'' had met expectations   the resulting murk makes it difficult to   answer the most basic question in investing  what did my company earn     why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place  because the numb  ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles  gaap  are  woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co  mpany's prospects  many institutional investors  most wall street analysts   and even many accountants say gaap is irrelevant    i don't know anyone wh  o uses gaap net income anymore for anything '' says lehman brothers inc  ac  counting expert robert willens  the problem is that gaap includes a lot of   noncash charges and one-time expenses  while investors need to be aware of   those charges  they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa  nce of ongoing operations     that's what operating earnings are supposed to do  but because they're calc  ulated in an ad hoc manner  with each company free to use its own rules  co  mparisons between companies have become meaningless    no investor--certain  ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful '' says  harvey l  pitt  chairman of the securities   exchange commission  the sec   is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and   perhaps restrict use of pro formas     what's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an  d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income  in the end  in  vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne  t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe  r    out of hand '' a widespread consensus is building to do just that  in   early november  s p proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta  llying operating earnings  only the week before  the financial accounting s  tandards board  the rulemakers for gaap  had announced that they  too  woul  d be taking up this issue  volcker says the international accounting standa  rds board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings       over the past two or three years  the use of creative earnings measures h  as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of  hand '' says david m  blitzer  s p's chief investment strategist    earnin  gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to  evaluate a company  if people want to use an operating-earnings measure  w  e better all know what we're looking at ''    without those standards in place  the gap between earnings according to gen  erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to wall street  is only going to grow wider and more confusing  look at the variance in ea  rnings per share calculated

did we get into this mess  investors and analysts have been calculating  operating earnings for years  and for years  reasonable people could more   or less agree on how to do it  then came the dot-com bubble  along with inc  reased pressure from wall street for companies to meet their quarterly earn  ings forecasts  suddenly  companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv  entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants  th  ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a  llowed upstart companies to show a profit    tower of babel '' pro forma fo  rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter  within the same company  casting doubt on their validity  and these days    the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever  s   p's tallies fall between the two  s p's numbers are more systematic than pr  o forma  but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard    investo  rs are facing a tower of babel '' says robert k  elliott  former chief of t  he american institute of certified public accountants  aicpa  and a retired  kpmg partner    it's not standardized  and the numbers are not audited ''      that makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance  in the quarter end  ed on sept      nortel networks corp  offered shareholders at least three e  arnings numbers to choose from  by conservative gaap accounting  the teleco  mmunications giant lost $     a share  the company also provided two possib  le pro forma options  a    cents loss that excluded   special charges '' in  cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges  and a still bette  r    cents loss that further excluded $    billion of   incremental charges   '' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab  les  wall street chose the rosiest one     confusing  you bet  companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi  ng out that they're merely filling a void  investors are clamoring for a me  asure that gives them better insight into their company's future  the goal   is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th  ose operations    there are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat  ing earnings '' says volcker    it is an effort to provide some continuity   and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company '' besides  a  s companies like to point out  they still have to report gaap earnings  and  investors are free to ignore everything else     there's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of gaap than the $   billion   asset write-downs by jds uniphase corp   the biggest charge of the year  ne  ar the height of the telecom bull market in july        the san jose  calif     maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor   sdl inc  for $   billion in stock  when the deal closed in february  its as  sets ballooned from $   billion

involving cash  the charge-  off was all about the past  a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of  hand  to analyze the company's prospects  they excluded the $   billion ch  arge    the

glacial pace  are jds's pro forma numbers realistic-  -a fair gauge of jds's ongoing operations  right now  it's hard for investo  rs to judge  and that's the kind of ambiguity s p and others would like to   eliminate  in november  s p circulated a memo on how to standardize operati  ng earnings  under the proposal  operating earnings would include the costs  of purchases  research and development  restructuring costs  including sev  erance   write-downs from ongoing operations  and the cost to the company o  f stock options  it would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses  impairme  nt of goodwill  litigation settlements  and the gain or loss on the sale of  an asset     when s p applied roughly that formula to jds uniphase  it split the differe  nce between wall street and gaap  because of differences in what each group  included in their earnings calculations  the results were chaotic  using g  aap  the company lost $     a share  s p figures it lost $      while the c  ompany put the loss at    cents  meanwhile  wall street says it made   cent  s     the s p standard may make sense  but it raises the question  where is the f  inancial accounting standards board  the group in charge of gaap  chairman   edmund l  jenkins says fasb will be addressing the problems  still  investo  rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon  the pace of change at fasb tends   to be glacial  it typically takes four years to complete a new standard  in        for example  the board realized that standards on restructuring char  ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda    in june        the board finally issued a draft of a new standard  asked fo  r comments  and held a public hearing  in october        the board said it   still wasn't ready to put a fix in place  now  the recession has set off an  other wave of restructuring charges  and the fasb still doesn't have new ru  les     the slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden   changes in the market  the most recent failure followed the terrorist attac  ks on september     an fasb task force  unable to come up with a set of rul  es for separating september    costs from general expenses  instead told co  mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item  so  gaap earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan  y's general performance  many companies have nevertheless broken those cost  s out in their unaudited press releases     many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter  indeed       is shapin  g up to be one for the record books  a poor economy and the devastating aft  ereffects of september    have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a  re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen  but there's a gro  wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide  missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char  ges  the temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now  while   investors are braced for bad news  not only can managers sweep away yesterd  ay's errors  but tomorrow's earnings will look even better     the basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char  ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di  stort the truth about a company's performance  usually  big charges fall in  to a few categories  including charges for laying off workers and restructu  ring a company  charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur  chased  charges for investments that have lost value  and charges for inven  tory that has become obsolete  in a recent study  harvard business school p  rofessor mark t  bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the  se charges unusual  that gives them a rationale for excluding them from the  ir pro forma calculations     lots of critics disagree  saying such charges are often an inevitable part   of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo  ry  they certainly should not be ignored by investors    charges are real s  hareholder wealth that's been lost '' argues david w  tice  manager of the   prudent bear fund  a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up     so f  ar this year    it's money they spent on something no longer worth what it   was  a correction of past earnings  or a reserve for costs moving forward    whatever the reason  it's a real cost to the company  and that hurts shareh  olders '' without standards  excessive write-offs from operating earnings c  an obscure actual performance  without any rules  companies calculate opera  ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po  ssible light  dell computer corp  is a good example of this   heads i win    tails you lose'' school of accounting  for years  dell benefited from gains  in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in  its reported earnings  where they appeared as a separate line on the incom  e statement  but this year  when those gains turned to losses  the computer  maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $    million drag  dell   spokesman michael maher says the company's press releases and sec filings b  reak out investment income and give gaap numbers as well as pro forma    in  our view  the numbers are reported clearly '' says maher    it's all out t  here for the consuming public '' past puffery  many experts believe special  charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated  what should inve  stors make of a company such as gateway inc   two restructuring charges in   the first and third quarters  minus a small extraordinary gain  totaled $       billion  or about $    million more than the company made in              and      combined  which is the truer picture of its performance and poten  tial  the write-offs or the earnings  write-offs for customer financing are  another example  when nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to  customers by $    million in september  it effectively admitted it had boo  ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating  its performance in those earlier periods  in addition  nortel says booking  sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues  tech companies blame  the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs  and these are  n't isolated examples  peter l  bernstein  publisher of newsletter economic  s   portfolio strategy  found that from      to           of earnings vanis  hed into write-offs     big charge-offs can also distort future performance  critics contend that e  xcess reserves are often used as a sort of   cookie jar'' from which earnin  gs can be taken in future quarters to meet wall street's expectations  or c  harges taken this year  for example  which is apt to be a lousy one for mos  t companies anyway  might include costs that would otherwise have been take  n in future periods  prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni  ngs  rules for figuring operating earnings would help  but this is an area   that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite  a certain amount of abuse    people are going to write off everything they  can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway '' s  ays robert g  atkins  a mercer management consultant     part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the  m off  believing that with the bad news out in the open  the company is poi  sed for a brighter future  since gateway detailed its third-quarter charge   of $    million on oct      wall street has bid the stock up      compared   with a    runup for the s p         often  though  investors should take exactly the opposite message  if  for   example  part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training  infor  mation-technology spending  or research and development  the cuts could dep  ress future performance  says baruch lev  a professor of accounting at the   stern school of business at new york university    are these really one-tim  e events '' he asks    or is this the beginning of an avalanche '' indeed    morgan stanley dean witter   co  strategist steve galbraith has found that   in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf  ormed the stock market by    percentage points    la la land '' investors a  re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year  even if the economy  doesn't continue to worsen  why  the transition to a new gaap rule that ch  anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re  flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl  e assets  under the new rule  companies will have to assess their propertie  s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value  falls  an informal survey by financial executives international of its mem  ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t  o take more charges     but figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task  unless t  here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price  v  aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules      what this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com  ing up with their own tests for impairment '' says the stern school's profe  ssor paul r  brown    it's la la land ''    while the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam  es  it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d  ot-com fiasco  indeed

changed  the risk is always there  there's risk in investing   in stocks  bonds and even u s  treasuries because of interest-rate  fluctua  tions   there's risk in real estate  too     so the question

james lam  founder of erisk  a consulting firm       as an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man  agement of price risks  i have been an admirer of enron's elaborate disclos  ure of its risk management practices  and yet  in a cascade of events over   a period of just three weeks from mid-october  it lost two-thirds of its sh  are value  became the subject of a us securities exchange commission  sec    investigation  and was taken over by a rival a third in size   latest repor  ts create some doubt about whether this will go through   what went wrong  no  the events had nothing to do with dabhol  indeed  if  for us in india    enron will always be associated with the controversial power project  elsew  here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting  finance a  nd general management   on second thoughts  even its indian adventures woul  d make an excellent case study      but first  a recount of what happened  after announcing on october     with  out much explanation or transparency  that it has taken a charge of $     b  illion against equity  enron's share price started tumbling  apparently  th  e charge was the result of some financial transactions  and the sec launche  d an investigation  the chief financial officer  cfo   who was directly inv  olved with the transactions  the company's treasurer and a couple of other   senior officials were sacked     perhaps most damagingly  enron revised its accounts from      onwards  redu  cing profits by about $     million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil  ar amount  as a result  enron's credit rating was downgraded     it seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr  ading  but in its investment activities controlled by the cfo  these compri  sed private equity  and enron's share in each of the investee companies was  kept artificially below    per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts  to  this end  outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in enron  itself  should the value of the investee company ies  fall below agreed th  reshold s      all this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet  and   mitigate their impact on reported profits  many other us corporations inclu  ding j p morgan chase  which had large private equity investments  have suf  fered on this score  see world money october      enron wanted to avoid thi  s and  last year  paid its since-dismissed cfo $    million for his creativ  e accounting genius     incidentally  those enamoured of us gaap and its alleged superiority over t  he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th  e company's auditors one of the big five firms  which was paid $    million  as audit fees and $    million for other services by enron last year     the restatement of the accounts from      onwards became necessary as the e  nron management board and the auditors were forced  on review  to admit tha  t at least some of the transactions should have been on  rather than off  b  alance sheet  details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o  ut  but what has come out is bad enough     but this apart  a billion dollar hit for a company of the size  $     billi  on  or cash flow  $   billion  of enron is  by itself  hardly a death warra  nt  but it turned out to be just that for enron     perhaps because it was too arrogant  perhaps also because its accounts lack  ed transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was  always somewhat fragile     but there are two other points worth noting  the professionalism of equity   analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin  g and producing  as for the first  the professional analysts were surely aw  are of the opaqueness of the accounts but few questioned the management agg  ressively on the subject  perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified   the spirit of the times trading assets was what the "masters of the univers  e" did  not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars  the   enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a  ctivity of trading in power and gas  with skilling  the former ceo  claming  that "we are on the side of angels  we are taking on the entrenched monopo  lies  we are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world   "  the quotation is from an interview in businessweek  prior to skilling's   inglorious exit from enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst      for the analysts  there was also safety in numbers  skilling claimed that "  enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec  hnologies and physical technologies"  bringing derivatives theory to tradin  g in power and gas  obviously  the fate of long term capital management has  not led to more sober management of trading risks     surely the role of "markets" should be to reduce the distance  and cost  be  tween producer and consumer  one does feel that there is something perverse  in a society that values  in terms of compensation  the trader  don't forg  et this is just a euphemism for the speculator  over the producer whether i  n the bond  currency or power and gas markets  the markets and  indeed  gre  ed obviously have a role to play  but surely the pendulum needs to swing a   little bit to the left  copyright        dow jones   company  inc  all rights reserved      india's mehta comments on birla group offer to buy enron stake

6.0	we are nearing the "final" form of the document for further use  i have asked bradford to speak with you regarding use of it for major trading counterparties that may not be investment grade  but with whom credit sees the ability to greatly enhance our liquidity via netting of margin requirements  not the small accounts   two issues     do you think we should write a risk memo concerning the issues surrounding the ultimate effectiveness under the code and "square setoff" rights  basically  the intent would be to clarify that if a court did not enforce the close-out netting  and then did not enforce the square setoff  our collateral position on a trading master by trading master basis could be underwater because we would have netted the positions under the master netting agreement for margining purposes  further to this  the bankruptcy reform aspects of this issue are not moving as previously hoped due to consumer issues and current events     fyi  it has come to my attention this week that global finance has consummated a receivable financing  and desires to consummate additional such financings which conflict with master netting agreements in place  as well as setoff language in trading contracts  and with the general concept of master netting for the future  we are meeting tomorrow with bradford and global finance representatives to gather facts  sort through the issues  and try to resolve what appear to be different objectives concerning trading receivables  from a cash perspective  i would think enron as whole would get more benefit from master netting  dollar for dollar benefit  than loan security  which would never be a dollar for dollar benefit --do you think this is a correct analysis

6.0	martin  subsequent to my last e-mail i discovered an additional detail which may po  ssibly clarify why ence prefers to purchase the chilean e  globulus species  to the brazilian species for pulp production  it would appear that the e   globulus species holds up better than the various brazilian species during  the refining process  while most papermakers generally don't refine hardw  oods and softwoods with the same equipment  many smaller european mills are  unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingl  y do use a single refiner for all grades  this is particularly true of the  italian mills  since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining req  uired for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics  opaci  ty  etc    these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suit  ed for this type of processing  accordingly  the globulus species  which i  s also the predominant species in the iberian peninsula  holds up much bett  er under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus  in any case  i hope this helps shed additional light on this issue  and  as  always  please feel free to revert with any questions you might have  tha  nks

6.0	by telefax of november     uriel dutton of f j provided a proposed waiver letter agreement for our review  i will have copies of that proposed agreement circulated by hand-delivery and fax to all those on this list and to mariner's gc  at present  i am not sending this e-mail to mariner's gc  if there is someone else i need to send this e-mail to  please let me know  chuck and i have reviewed the letter  believe it to be overly broad  and hope that f j is willing to negotiate further  along the following lines     on page    third full paragraph  second line  we suggest inserting "enron corp  and " between "representation of" and "enron's affiliates"     on page    paragraph      we are concerned about the third sentence  which reads as follows  "enron corp  agrees that it will cause each existing or future affiliate of enron corp  to comply with the agreements of the enron entities herein set forth " we think  although we do not know for sure  that f j's concern is that f j may become adverse in the future to some existing enron entity that f j does not currently represent  or that does not currently exist  and that either of these two entities may seek to assert disqualification based on f j's current representation of enron entities  if this is the reason for the sentence  we don't see how an existing enron entity or future enron entity could assert a conflict that has been waived by the enron entity that is actually being represented  we also have a concern about asking enron corp  to cause all of its "affiliates"  as defined in the letter agreement  to comply with it  enron corp  may not have the power to require all its "affiliates" to comply  our suggestion would be that this letter agreement be signed on behalf of all the actual enron entities currently represented by f j  including mariner     on page       lines from the top  we find objectionable the language that begins  "without limiting the foregoing   " it seems to us that here  f j wants all the enron companies to be considered separately for disqualification purposes  and perhaps to be able to sue one enron entity even though f j is representing another enron entity in a substantially related matter     on pages  -   paragraph      we have a concern about the third sentence  which reads as follows  "if dynegy declines or fails to do so promptly after receipt of our request  it is expressly agreed and understood that f j shall be entitled   " our concern is that we are committing enron entities to an agreed course of action post-merger based on speculation as to what dynegy may or may not do  our suggestion would be that we simply ask f j to delete all but the first two sentences of paragraph         please note that under the terms of this proposed agreement  we are not requiring f j to be liable for the ramp-up costs of new counsel for  e g   the licensing project or the asbestosis cases  in the event that enron corp  cannot be dismissed from the asbestosis cases pre-trial   we do not believe that ramp-up costs will be something f j will agree to if we need f j to take on the new mariner matter  mariner's gc called me today to advise that it was urgent that she know today or tomorrow whether f j was going to be able to represent mariner on a new  critical asset-sale matter that is scheduled to close no later than december     otherwise  she will need to hire other counsel to handle that matter  please let us have your comments as soon as possible  britt
