Ken Lay Resigns from Board	Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors. His resignation is effective immediately. In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization. Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal." He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."	1
Howdy!	Hi Sandra, I hope you had a nice Christmas and a fun holiday season. We as you can imagine with three 5 year old boys, it was hectic but, the look on their faces Christmas morning was priceless. I wanted to let you know that I am leaving Prebon as of January 15th. I have spent the last eight years of my 16 years in the Energy field with Prebon and we part on the best of terms. I am talking with a few banks, a consulting firm and some energy companies, but also plan on spending some time at the house with the family. I will let you know when and where I decide to go. Hopefully we can work together again in the future. Best wishes for continued success in 2002 and the years to come. Please give my best to Kenny. Sincerely, Bill	1
Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy	Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties. Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own. We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build. Following are the major components of the transaction. Deal Terms -- The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share. For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing. -- ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger. Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas. -- Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. -- The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year. Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary. Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO. I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman. Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes. Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman. Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron. Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration. The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined. The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002. This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers. As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company. We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions. Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations. I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible. As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history. We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses. I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps. We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>. If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>. We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions. If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670. I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company. Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience. Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse. And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Overview of Investor Conference Call	Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview = of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call. We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter= ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit= y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe= ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses. It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot = of significant events that led to our current situation: -- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co= re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu= rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve= r imagined when we made these investments; -- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa= ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex= tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet; -- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in= vestor confidence, which has been very damaging; -- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under= stand financial and operating disclosures; and -- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d= iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo= usly reported earnings. We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three= areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review. Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear= nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th= ese include: -- Natural gas pipeline businesses; -- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe; -- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and -- Coal businesses in North America and Europe. The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou= r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti= me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering= these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002= . I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple = of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity = concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i= mprovement in our counterparty relationships. Non-Core Businesses Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d= ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the= return from them has been dismal. We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect = that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash= that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre= ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th= ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN= G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga= s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale= is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals. Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga= s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev= eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete= rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff= icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation. Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make= reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b= ecomes available. Credit Rating/10-Q Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that = our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba= lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr= edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows: -- Moody's at Baa3 "Under Review for Further Downgrade" -- Fitch at BBB- "Evolving Status" -- S&P at BBB- "CreditWatch Negative" We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin= and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1= 0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. = 19. We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we= ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference = call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next = few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve= stors under "SEC Filings." =20 =20 In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a = joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio= n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro= xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes= available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se= curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect= us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about = Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop= ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b= e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als= o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations= , Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) = 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu= ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (= 713) 646-3302.

Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017). Thank you for your help in this matter.	1
Jeff McMahon Named CFO	Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.	1
Subsidiary Equity or Phantom Equity	Michelle, This email confirms our discussion that one of the mandates of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Enron is that they approve all formations of and grants related to any subsidiary equity or phantom equity plans. Mary and I can and will work closely and quickly with any group needing to get this done. Mary is responsible for presenting the plan for approval to the Compensation Committee after Tax, Legal, Accounting, Commercial and HR interests are scrubbed. These types of plans have accounting, legal and tax complexities that need to be worked out and change regularly. Also, it is very important that no written or verbal promise related to equity grants before Compensation Committee approval is obtained.	0
IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan	If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message. We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20. We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July. We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular. Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals. The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk. As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.	1

Message from Ken Lay	Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately. To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company. Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees. The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy. This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations. I truly believe Enron can and will survive. I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does. During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity. I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community. Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here. Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years. Ken Lay	1
UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week	Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today. We want to encourage you to come to work. We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options. Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process. I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy. But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee. I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices. Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority. We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue. Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination. I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you. I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so. While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them. We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search. We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni. We will share more information on these efforts soon. I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation. Ken	1
Change of Control Provisions	As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron. The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry. Thank you.	1
Dynegy Discussions	Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies. As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron. This is just one of several options that we are considering. Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy. We have no additional information we can share at this time. We'll keep you updated as developments occur.	1
Daily Update	Here is an update on new developments that have occurred over the past few days. New Board Member & Committee Elected Today, the Enron Board of Directors elected William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas, to the Board. Bill currently holds the John Jeffers Research Chair in Law and the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair in Law at The University of Texas School of Law, where he teaches tort, products liability, jurisprudence, legal process, civil procedure and contracts. He received his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1973. Additionally, the Board established a Special Committee that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties. The Special Committee, to be chaired by Bill, comprises independent directors Frank Savage, CEO of Savage Holding LLC as chairman, Paulo Ferraz Pereira, executive vice president of Brazilian-owned investment bank Group Bonanza, and Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings, Inc. The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate. The committee has retained William R. McLucas, a former head of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering as its counsel. Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering has retained Deloitte & Touche to provide independent accounting advice. SEC Changes Inquiry to Investigation We also reported today that the SEC has opened a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and were previously the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry. This is not unusual and we welcome this investigation and are confident that this matter will finally be put to rest. With so much publicity surrounding our company right now, I want to ask you to keep in mind that not all media reports are accurate or even based on factual information. We are committed to communicating updates to you every day by voice mail, e-mail or both, so that you know the factual status of our company's situation. We have created an Enron Updates Intranet site (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>) to keep you apprised of current events. Please check back frequently for information and new developments. I truly thank you for your continued hard work and support of our company.	1

Organizational Announcement	As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce. We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base. Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron. We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman. David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function. The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman. Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities. Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife. Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis. David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman. A detailed organizational chart is attached.

Middle Market Group	Tim Belden and I are pleased to announce that Jim Buerkle, Chris Lackey and John Van Gelder are joining the Middle Market Group. The Middle Market Group will continue to focus on commodity marketing throughout the WSCC under the leadership of Stewart Rosman, Paul Choi and John Malowney. This group will report to me to enable closer coordination and integration with our Origination group and to ensure that Enron has complete and seamless coverage of the power market. Chris Foster will continue to lead our growing services business and report to Tim. Please join me in congratulating Jim, Chris and John on their new roles. Chris Calger	0
Natural Gas Origination	Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers. In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

E-Tag 1.7 training	Good Morning, Last Tuesday I attended the OATI training on E-Tag 1.7 in Houston. Although this new tagging won't be implemented until March, we will have access to the Test site sometime in November or December. This new way of tagging is very different from what we have now, and each group that makes tags is going to have to allow time for practice. Also, because the format of the new tags is so different, the old templates will not work. New templates will need to be created. Please let me know if you want to have formal training sessions, and I will work up a series of them for January and February.	1
General Update	Jim and Rob: I hope you are both well and was really pleased to see that last week's merger negotiations reached a successful outcome.This must have required an incredible effort in the timescale and given everything else that is going on.I very much hope this will allow you to enjoy a more stable period after the events of the last few weeks.You both have many friends at Linklaters and we are all pulling for you at this time. I also thought you may like to have a brief overview of the main areas in which we are assisting at the moment.These are as follows: 1Merger:We are working with Robert Eickenroht on the UK/European anti-trust aspects.This kicked off with a conference call today.Greatly appreciate the instructions, Jim. 2Dabhol:We are continuing our role on Dabhol which is now primarily focused on the litigation side and a major commitment for a 2 partner team-Chris Walker is ,I believe, in Houston tomorrow to meet with Bruce Lundstrum and others.Input from the projects side continues (principally in relation to Sch 11,PPA) but is not likely to be extensive over the next month or so given the current emphasis in India. 3Enron Europe:We are in close contact with Mark and have a number of ongoing / new matters.In particular, we have a dedicated team advising Europe on its position and contingency planning for current circumstances-this team has been liaising with Mark Haedicke and the Weil Gotchal team.We are also assisting on some potential disposals in non core business areas.Our London secondee remains in place. 4Other:We have a number of ongoing matters ranging from SEDCO litigation through a bid for LNG purchases from Nigeria LNG.Given the understandable emphasis on cost control at this time, it may be that we should review these matters to determine whether you feel it appropriate to scale back legal spend in some areas? On the question of payment,we have invoices totalling more than ?5 million outstanding and this level of commitment ,of course, continues to grow in the light of our ongoing work.As mentioned on Friday, we do need to reduce this to a more manageable level ( we are currently speaking with Mark and Bruce, in particular, to find a way of achieving this) and your continuing support in this effort would be greatly appreciated. We really want to do all we can,at both a personal and professional level, to support Enron at this time-I am particularly conscious of the support and friendship you have given to me over the years.If there is anything else we can do, please do call me at any time.For convenience my nos. are: W:44 207 456 5912 M:44 7733 124030 H:44 1959 533292 Best Wishes Stuart	1
Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017). Thank you for your help in this matter.	1

Ken Lay Resigns from Board	Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors. His resignation is effective immediately. In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization. Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal." He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."	1

Northern Natural Gas	Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas. Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30. We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy. While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses. The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy. It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts. We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas. Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services. Ken Dear ETS Colleague: On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy. In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas. Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved. The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court. For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business. Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas. Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS. Keep up the good work! Stan	1
FW: Wishing you well	As some of you might already know, I resigned today. I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron. Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people. I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January. I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life. As always, it has been a pleasure working with you! Keep in touch. I will be interested to see what happens. Carole C. Frank Enron Net Works	2
Organizational Announcement	As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently. Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee. This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees. The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11. Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections. Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain. From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun. Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed. We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future. Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week. This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company. By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business. Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership. We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO. It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO. The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder. We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January. As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention. This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee. We will update you periodically on our process. Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization. Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley. Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee. Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently. In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp. Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis. Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development. In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation. Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon. Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM. As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan. Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December: Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO. We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling. Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term. We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process. We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.	1
Supported Internet Email Addresses	Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already. Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses. To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com. IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center. We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com. Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.	2
UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses	Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment. We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now. If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com. Thank you for your support.	2
Natural Gas Origination	Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers. In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

FW: Re-start/Integration Planning	Group... Well the move to Netco begins. I would like to schedule a meeting for Wednesday, January 2nd at 10:00 a.m. to discuss the below and map out our plan of action. As I am sure you are aware, this is our course to set, so let's think outside the framework on the most effective way to start a new company. I am following e-mail from home. If you have thoughts/concerns/questions prior to the meeting, let me know. Happy New Year to everyone!	1
Dynegy Discussions	Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies. As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron. This is just one of several options that we are considering. Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy. We have no additional information we can share at this time. We'll keep you updated as developments occur.	1
Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy	Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties. Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own. We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build. Following are the major components of the transaction. Deal Terms -- The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share. For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing. -- ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger. Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas. -- Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. -- The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year. Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary. Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO. I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman. Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes. Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman. Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron. Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration. The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined. The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002. This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers. As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company. We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions. Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations. I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible. As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history. We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses. I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps. We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>. If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>. We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions. If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670. I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company. Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience. Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse. And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6400, Fax: (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3002.

NETCO	The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO. Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized. The main areas to focus on over the next week are:- (i) Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7) To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii) Budget (due Jan 3, 2002) To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii) Seating Plans Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv) Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements. I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis. Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list. Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are. I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this. I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. Happy New Year Louise	1
Logistics Commercial Realignment	After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows: Wholesale Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively. Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby. Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta. Retail Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team. Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Assistants - Please forward on to your groups.	0
UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week	Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today. We want to encourage you to come to work. We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options. Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process. I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy. But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee. I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices. Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority. We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue. Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination. I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you. I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so. While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them. We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search. We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni. We will share more information on these efforts soon. I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.	1
MD Anderson	MD Anderson has approximately 500 job openings, some of which may be suitable for former Enron employees. The jobs vary but include a number of IT and administrative positions. MD Anderson's potential interest in employing laid off Enron employees came to our attention via Anne Marie Giltrop of MD Anderson who spoke with Angela Davis. This morning, I spoke with Ms. Giltrop. In light of our policy of only providing neutral references and other liability considerations, I stated that I did not believe we would provide MD Anderson a list of employees who were laid off, but that I would try to find an approved vehicle for getting information regarding job openings at MD Anderson to our former employees. The MD Anderson web site does not reflect all current open positions, so I suggested that, if approved on both ends, MD Anderson could provide a list of openings with job descriptions that could be made available to former Enron employees. Ms. Giltrop is attempting to obtain appropriate approval from MD Anderson. She later phoned to inform me that I should expect to hear more from Deborah Manning, Jim Dorn, or Martha Jones. On our end, I have contacted David Oxley who put me in touch with Cindy Olson. Sarah Davis will now handle coordinating relations with MD Anderson. This is an important opportunity for former employees, and for Enron and MD Anderson as good Houston citizens. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.	0
Staff development	Shigeki Kawano, who has been the head of our office in Tokyo since it opened in April 2000, has resigned from that position effective December 31.

We have enjoyed having him as a colleague and appreciate his efforts on behalf of the Association. I am sure that each of you join me in wishing him well in the future.	0
Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017). Thank you for your help in this matter.	1
Natural Gas Origination	Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers. In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Xcel Energy Inc. to Northern States Power Company	On Aug. 18, 2000, New Century Energies, Inc. and Northern States Power Company (NSP) merged and formed Xcel Energy Inc. As part of the merger, NSP transferred its existing utility operations that were being conducted directly by NSP at the parent company level to a newly formed subsidiary of Xcel Energy named Northern States Power Company. Because of the merger, the record was overlayed in Global Counterparty and all history for Northern States Power Company is now under Xcel Energy. A new Northern States Power Company record has been created in Global. I will be moving all Xcel deals with a July 1, 2001 forward flow date to the newly created record for Northern States Power Company. Xcel Energy will be inactivated in Enpower. Please choose Northern States Power Company (NORTHERNST) for future deals with this counterparty.	1
ENA Gas Structuring	In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES. I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately. Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals. Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals. Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed. Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team. Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort. Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations: Mark Breese EB-1457a Ed McMichael EB-1456c Melissa Solis EB-1456d We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor. This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.	1

Corrected Organization Announcement	Organization Announcement (Correction) I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused. I had indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not correct. Ken will be supporting OEC. Corrected announcement is provided below. It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. EH&S Asset Operations. He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.

Cliff Baxter	It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron. We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family. Cliff is a unique talent. His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career. He will be missed. Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business. Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999. We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions. Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.	0

Jeff McMahon Named CFO	Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.	1
Park City Bound	Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron. I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha. It would be great to see old friends up there.

FW: Logistics Commercial Realignment	After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows: Wholesale Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively. Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby. Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta. Retail Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team. Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.	0

Thank You, Also!!	Ken I know it has been several years since we spoke, but I wanted to thank you = for your kind note, and to personally thank you for the opportunities that = Enron has provided to me over the years. I am one of those few who was already with HNG in 1984, and still vividly r= emember the day that you arrived. The building was immediately permeated b= y a sense of urgency and excitement. That pace was relentless - and addict= ive. I also remember in detail the Internorth merger in 1985, and feel pro= ud to have played a part, however small it was, in that transaction. The late 1980's and the early 1990's will probably always be my favorite ye= ars of my working life. There were so many initiatives in Enron in their i= nfancy. Although it was an initiative that faced insurmountable economics = and ultimately failed, I am grateful that Enron gave me the opportunity to = participate in the natural gas vehicle adventure. I never really understoo= d until that adventure the full meaning of the old axiom that the lessons l= earnt best are those learnt from adversity and from making mistakes!! I will try to remember Enron with those years through the mid-1990's in min= d. I have to say that I consider those to be the best years, because I hav= e witnessed a degradation of the corporate culture in the past few years. = That is clearly a subjective assessment, and should be treated as such. I = am under no illusions: Enron is a business entity operating in markets and= environments that are relentlessly competitive, with a primary responsibil= ity to its shareholders. But I and many of my colleagues who also have lon= g tenure at Enron and its predecessors share this assessment. I am always = amused by the irony of the stated value "Ruthlessness, callousness and arro= gance do not belong here", since these appear to be the key defining person= al characteristics of most of the senior management of ENA in recent years. And unfortunately, the very sale of HPL by Enron has been for some an examp= le of the degradation of corporate culture. For myself, I know what to exp= ect - I know that with corporate divestitures comes the need to control inf= ormation as the transaction evolves. But for the "rank and file" - those w= ho live from paycheck to paycheck - it has not been a pleasant experience. = They maintained their professionalism (indeed many of them probably worked= harder than anybody else to make the transaction happen). In return, ther= e has been an appalling lack of timely information and misinformation from = Enron management and HR department with respect to their benefits and caree= r choices. HR in particular has been totally non-responsive to individual = inquiries in the past few months - not returning phone calls and emails fro= m HPL employees with questions, even after the transaction was announced. = Even as recently as the past couple of days, only upon receipt of their ter= mination packages did several dozen employees discover that they had been m= isinformed by HR with respect to some aspects of their remaining Enron bene= fits. For myself, my years at Enron will remain a high point of my career. It is= a badge of honor in the energy industry to have been a dealmaker at Enron,= particularly for as many years as I was there. I know Enron will continue= to set the standards by most measures in this industry, and, for what its = worth, I humbly wish you continued success.	1
Farewell	Good afternoon! It is with great sadness that I must inform you that I have resigned from E= nron. My last day is June 8. Enron was a wonderful place to work and I hav= e had so many opportunities to meet quality people. The most fulfilling ac= complishment for me is Cougars@Enron. This group has enabled me a unique e= xperience in meeting many of you and creating a truly special team. I feel = there is a real sense of Cougar pride here which made my experience that mu= ch more pleasurable. Although I am leaving, Cougars@Enron remains. We wil= l elect a new President prior to my departure. If you show him/her as much= enthusiasm and support as you have shown me, the group will flourish to ne= w heights. Always remember, it is you that makes this group successful!!!= With over 600 of you employed by this company, you make a difference. It= shows in everything we do from one of the (if not the) most successful fir= st year constituent golf tournament in HAO history/ to the inspiring of Tex= as A&M to form Aggies@Enron in our image/ to being the envy of other organi= zed groups. I am incredibly proud to be a Cougar, not just because of the = university but the quality of our graduates. Please keep the faith! With = your support we will achieve new heights! Again, THANK YOU and let's keep = in contact. Like I said we are Cougars whether we are employed here or else= where. My email address in jeffreymcclellan@zcougars.com.	2
Leaving California Residential Market	Dear Mr. Lay, Recently I received notice that Enron will no longer provide electric service for my residence "as a result of continued uncertainty in this market, as well as a lack of clarity on the future of direct access." I find this very disappointing and would like Enron to re-consider this decision. I am a strong believer in the free market system and, in part, it was for this reason that I chose Enron as my electric service provider several years ago when the market in California was deregulated. I also chose Enron because of my knowledge of your company, its leadership and the strategic direction you have provided. Never was there a time in the marketing of electric service to the State of California for a company such as Enron to exhibit long range thinking & leadership. This is an opportunity for Enron to show commitment and staying power in a market that has "radically changed" and lacking in clarity. I recognize it is not an easy decision to change a decision that has already been made. However, I also consider you a risk taking, strong and capable leader who wants to make the right decision for its ultimate customers in spite of short term political decisions (that will get changed) by Governor Davis.	1

Update on Intelligent Diagnostics	Dear Shareholders, Several months have passed since I last told you of the pending sale of Intelligent Diagnostics Inc (formerly known as askRed.com or DrRedDuke Inc) to Dynasty Technologies. Unfortunately, the deal originally contemplated appears unlikely due to adverse market conditions and financing difficulties, which seem to be seriously impacting Dynasty's business just like many other businesses. Dynasty has been shrinking its operations and moving some of their operation overseas. We are currently exploring a new business plan with Dynasty that would involve a newly created company spun off from Dynasty as the principal vehicle for development of the diagnostic software and related products. Such an approach may be the best way to proceed. However, a newly created entity will face all of the usual problems as any other startup, plus it will be doing so in a harsh economic environment. If you have any suggestions, please advise. I regret that we still have this business in a state of limbo and wish I could offer some encouraging news based on signs in the marketplace. I'm sure you are seeing the same bleak outlook that the WEDGE team, Dr. Casscells and I are encountering as we continue to chase leads for new sources of funds. I will send more updates as the possibilities evolve. Please feel free to call me at any time....713 332 6856 (office) 713 667 5420 (home).	1

Media Coverage of Enron	While it has been discouraging to see an endless stream of negative news coverage about Enron, we want you to know about some positive news that is starting to emerge. ABC News was at Enron today because they want to do a story about Enron's future, our business going forward and the tremendous work being performed by the remaining 20,000 employees worldwide. The segment is scheduled to appear on both Good Morning America and on ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on Wednesday, Feb. 20. The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. CST. Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight. While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron, the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging. We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air. Additionally, two articles featuring interviews with Interim CEO Steve Cooper ran yesterday in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times. We are forwarding them to you for your information. Thank you for your support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees.	1
Jeff McMahon Named CFO	Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.	1

Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy	Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties. Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own. We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build. Following are the major components of the transaction. Deal Terms -- The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share. For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing. -- ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger. Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas. -- Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. -- The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year. Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary. Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO. I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman. Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes. Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman. Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron. Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration. The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined. The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002. This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers. As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company. We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions. Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations. I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible. As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history. We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses. I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps. We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>. If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>. We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions. If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670. I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company. Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience. Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse. And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6400, Fax: (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3002.

Program Changes	As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history. We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition. It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ? ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program. The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders. Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored. Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service. Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ? Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely. As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations. Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored. We regret that we have had to make these changes. We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.	2
Logistics Commercial Realignment	After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows: Wholesale Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively. Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby. Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta. Retail Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team. Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.	0
Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017). Thank you for your help in this matter.	1
Jeff McMahon Named CFO	Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.	1
Ken Lay Resigns from Board	Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors. His resignation is effective immediately. In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization. Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal." He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."	1
Assistance for Former Employees	Many of you have friends who are no longer with the company, so we wanted to provide you an overview of continuing efforts to assist Enron's former employees. CAREER SERVICES Last December Enron established a website to assist former employees identify jobs in Houston and throughout the United States.

Office Update	Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what = has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what= is likely to transpire in the weeks to come. I'd like to begin by apologi= zing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the= last couple of weeks. These have been very hard times and I know that peo= ple have wanted information. It has taken us nearly a week to sort through= who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron. =20 In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) wh= o do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do= , (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen= , and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.

UBS Wins	John Lavorato confirmed that UBS is indeed the winner. As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization. We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today. Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along. It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday. Approval from the judge is expected. I have a meeting in the next couple of hour where I will get more details. Stay tuned ...	1
Northern Natural Gas	Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas. Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30. We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy. While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses. The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy. It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts. We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas. Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services. Ken Dear ETS Colleague: On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy. In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas. Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved. The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court. For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business. Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas. Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS. Keep up the good work! Stan	1
Bankruptcy Management Committee	In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee. There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information. To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process. The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly. If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated. All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee. Firm Relationship Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.) Creditors' Committee U.S. Trustee Ernst & Young Accountants for the Creditor's Committee Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee Blackstone Financial advisors for Enron Batchelder and Partners Financial advisors for Enron Weil, Gotshal and Manges Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron Milbank Tweed Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee Andrews and Kurth Attorneys for Enron Corp The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee: Ray Bowen - Chairman Bob Butts Jim Fallon Dave Glassford Dave Gorte Mark Muller Julia Murray Lou Stoler Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court. It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors. Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.	1
Bids Open for Enron Trading Unit	Thursday December 20 5:39 AM ET Bids Open for Enron Trading Unit By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer HOUSTON (AP) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge has set in motion the bidding process for embattled Enron Corp.'s once-dominant trading operation, which some Wall Streets insiders say could fetch up to $1 billion. Enron said at a hearing Wednesday before Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York that it would allow parties to bid for all or part of the wholesale trading unit. Enron lawyer Martin J. Bienenstock said none of the 14 potential bidders to come forward so far have expressed interest in bidding for Enron's book of contracts, which Enron values at $5 billion to $7 billion. Bids are due Jan. 7; an auction will be held Jan. 10. Bienenstock said bidders are wary of the potential liabilities in the contracts and that the short time frame does not allow for a full review of the books. The company, however, wants to complete the auction as soon as possible to avoid losing traders to other financial companies. In Enron's home base of Houston Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that a state court should decide whether Enron must give rival Dynegy Inc. a key natural gas pipeline. Dynegy claims Enron signed away its right to Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline, a prized 16,500-mile system running between Texas and the Midwest, in exchange for $1.5 billion invested in Enron before a proposed merger of the two competitors collapsed in late November. Enron claims its smaller rival illegally terminated the $8.4 billion deal and therefore has no right to the pipeline. Enron and had argued that Dynegy's claim should be part of Enron's massive bankruptcy case filed in federal court in New York. U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ruled that Dynegy's suit should be heard in state court because the company's claim was not a core element of the bankruptcy. Harmon noted that Dynegy could have sued Enron if the former energy giant didn't seek Chapter 11 protection. ``It's what we predicted,'' said David Burns, a lawyer representing Dynegy in the lawsuit. ``If we don't have Northern Natural Gas turned over to us promptly, we will ask the court to provide an accelerated trial date on this.'' Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined comment on the decision. Dynegy sued Enron in Texas state court in Houston the day after Enron filed one of the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcies in U.S. history Dec. 2 and sued Dynegy for $10 billion for breach of contract in New York. Dynegy and other creditors also have asked that the bankruptcy case be moved to Houston, where Enron, Dynegy and many of Enron's 800 or so creditors are based. Gonzalez will consider those requests Jan. 7. Also Wednesday, nearly 40 of some 4,500 Enron employees laid off after the company filed for bankruptcy gathered outside Enron headquarters here to discuss the company's severance policy and sign a complaint to Enron on the lack of information. Some carried signs that displayed the word ``Moron'' under Enron's logo and said ``What were they thinking?'' Others wore T-shirts that said ``The Execs Who Stole Christmas.'' Gonzalez on Dec. 4 $1.5 billion in short-term financing to keep the company afloat and fund $4,500 severance payments. Former workers received those checks last week, but revelations that nearly 600 employees deemed critical to Enron's survival received more than $100 million in retention payments upset those entitled to more money under Enron's severance policy, they said. The company's severance policy says eligible workers are entitled to a week's pay for each full or partial year of employment and another week's pay for each $10,000 they earned in salary, up to a maximum of 26 weeks. ``We would like the company to honor its commitment,'' said Pete Chase, 31, who worked for Enron Energy Services for 18 months. Denne said the company cannot approve any severance payments above $4,500 for each employee without Gonzalez' approval. Employees can file claims with the judge for more severance pay. Instructions on how to do so are available on Enron's Web site (www.enron.com). ``The next step for Enron is for its creditors to assess its financial condition and assets,'' Denne said. ``Every employee is absolutely free to file a claim.'' Enron, formerly No. 7 on the Fortune 500 with stock trading near $90 a year ago, plummeted into bankruptcy after revelations of hidden debt and overstated earnings in October siphoned investor confidence and prompted traders to flee from what was once the world's largest buyer and seller of natural gas. Dynegy abandoned a plan to buy Enron for $8.4 billion when it continued to reveal serious financial problems and Enron's credit was downgraded to junk. Dynegy shares rose $3.08 to close at $23.98 on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron shares were down 6 cents to 44 cents, also on the NYSE.	1
Organizational Announcement	As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently. Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee. This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees. The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11. Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections. Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain. From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun. Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed. We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future. Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week. This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company. By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business. Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership. We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO. It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO. The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder. We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January. As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention. This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee. We will update you periodically on our process. Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization. Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley. Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee. Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently. In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp. Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis. Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development. In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation. Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon. Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM. As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan. Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December: Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO. We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling. Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term. We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process. We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.	1
FROM RAYMOND BOWEN, JR., EVP, FINANCE & TREASURER	Post-Petition Expenses Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal. Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission. Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors. New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming. In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses. All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation. Pre-Petition Expenses We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000. We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses. This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel. We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses. We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap. Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through. Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com. Thank you for your patience.	0
Layoffs	Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced. When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people. Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today. Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees. In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.

PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN	Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan. The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29: ? Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock. The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan. ? After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions. As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan. ? The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options. Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts. This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account. These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts. To move funds: On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu. On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts." This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC. To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.	1
Paul Kane Resigns	I regret to announce that Paul Kane tendered his resignation from Enron this afternoon effective close of business tomorrow, Friday November 30th. We are sorry to see him go. Please join me in wishing him well in his future endeavors.	1
Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017). Thank you for your help in this matter.	1
Jeff McMahon Named CFO	Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.	1
UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses	Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment. We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now. If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com. Thank you for your support. Enron Global Technology	2
hello	All, As many of you already know, I decided to take a position at EES, so this week suppose to be my last week in the Gas Fundamentals Group. It is a pretty satisfactory feeling to the reporting team and myself that we are able to contribute to the success of gas trading by providing over 100 reports every day. I certainly appreciated all your help, cooperation and friendship. Needless to say it was a great experience to work with you all. At Dave Dronet's request I'll stay one more week to transit my responsibilities to Kim Alexsander next week. Kim will lead the reporting team and continue provide the excellent support to you all. The reporting team is in good hands. Even after I move to another group, I am just a phone call away, I'll let you know my new phone # and continue to help you wherever I can. Thanks....

Lay It On the Line	At the all-employee meeting two weeks ago, I talked about the major challenges that I believe Enron is currently facing and what we are doing to address these issues. I also reviewed with you our vision for Enron to become "The World's Leading Company," and what that means to me. Your management team and I remain committed to this goal and are confident that by working together, we can achieve this vision. After the all-employee meeting, a number of you came forward to voice your concerns about what you saw as additional challenges for Enron, and for that, I thank you. We have already begun working on many of the concerns you expressed. Now, I would like to hear from more of you about what you see as the most critical issues facing Enron in the next twelve months. In other words, "Lay It on the Line" for me by completing the attached survey. I assure you that your individual answers to this survey will remain confidential. The new Management Committee will use this information to help us identify immediate action steps to address your key concerns. We will communicate the results to you, both positive and negative, and what we plan to do about them, as soon as we can. Thank you in advance for taking the time to help us move Enron toward its new vision of becoming "The World's Leading Company." We need your answers no later than Tuesday, September 4, 2001. To access the survey, click on or copy the following URL onto the Enron intranet site: <http://etcsurvey.corp.enron.com/wi/p0731404/i.asp>.

Media Reports	As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston. It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities. Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time. However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation. We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe. If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804. If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670. At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs. Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.	0

Organizational Announcement	As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce. We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base. Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron. We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.

Natural Gas Origination	Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers. In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

NETCO Employees at Enron	As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization. As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization. If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee. If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.	0
Message from Ken Lay	Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately. To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company. Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees. The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy. This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations. I truly believe Enron can and will survive. I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does. During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity. I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community. Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here. Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.	1
Update on Retention & Severance Plan	We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status. As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22. We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month. We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave. We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed. We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed. The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns. The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan. Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy. These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate. The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process. To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee. We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible. This is currently our top priority, bar none! When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be. Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place. We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation. The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved. That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse. We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan. We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court. We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court. With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future. In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week. And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.	2
Accounting Controls & Procedures Group	One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company. Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective. A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility. Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson. Joining Rick will be Donna Lowry who will manage compliance and records retention controls. To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process. In this regard, your cooperation with Rick and his team is appreciated.	1
Management Changes	As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron. Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses. It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses. Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities. Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.	0
Database Tracking of Activities	The Government Affairs group is involved in diverse and complex activities. Tracking and quantifying these activities is important for several obvious reasons - to keep upper management apprised of our activities; to illustrate the value added and risk managed by our group; and to keep each other properly informed so that we can better coordinate our efforts. Currently, these activities take place on an ad-hoc manual basis, which is time-consuming and inefficient. We have a tool already in place to track our activities - the Project Tracking database in Lotus Notes. Currently this application is used primarily for RCR's, but beginning November 1, 2001, the Government Affairs group will use this application to track all projects and efforts - replacing the need for manual updated spreadsheets and activity quantification "fire-drills". The Projects have several features to allow capture of sub-sets of information, including Updates, Risk, Origination and Valuation. ** Please note that this will become the only way that we'll gather this information. In other words, if you don't enter your data into Project Tracking, we won't know what you're doing! **( all other reports will be eliminated) The current Lotus Notes application will be discontinued as of October 31,2001 and will be converted to a web-based product. You'll find the web-based version as easy or even easier to use than Lotus Notes. Additionally, conversion to a new database structure will allow for more versatile report extraction. Before the conversion of the project data from Lotus Notes to Oracle, we need to do some data cleanup. Please expect a call in the next two weeks from Elizabeth Linnell, Bryan Gottfredson, or Darran Binns to schedule some time with you in person or on the phone regarding your current project list, additional projects to add, and a brief overview of the new system. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions and/or concerns.	2
FW: Wishing you well	As some of you might already know, I resigned today. I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron. Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people. I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January. I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life. As always, it has been a pleasure working with you! Keep in touch. I will be interested to see what happens. Carole C. Frank Enron Net Works	2
Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

Thank you for your help in this matter.	1
Enron Update	This has been a tough couple of weeks. I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company. Here's a rundown of events from last week: We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity. Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas. - The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties. The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry. As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us. Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2. Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB. Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-. All agency ratings are investment grade. Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that: EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday. Transaction counts remain higher than average. EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas. EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi. EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities. Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question. We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole. We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company. And that's where you come in. Look around you. Look at the excellence that you and your team represents. That's the reason we hired you - you're the best. Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other. Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.	1
Daily Update	Here is an update on new developments that have occurred over the past few days. New Board Member & Committee Elected Today, the Enron Board of Directors elected William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas, to the Board. Bill currently holds the John Jeffers Research Chair in Law and the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair in Law at The University of Texas School of Law, where he teaches tort, products liability, jurisprudence, legal process, civil procedure and contracts. He received his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1973. Additionally, the Board established a Special Committee that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties. The Special Committee, to be chaired by Bill, comprises independent directors Frank Savage, CEO of Savage Holding LLC as chairman, Paulo Ferraz Pereira, executive vice president of Brazilian-owned investment bank Group Bonanza, and Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings, Inc. The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate. The committee has retained William R. McLucas, a former head of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering as its counsel. Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering has retained Deloitte & Touche to provide independent accounting advice. SEC Changes Inquiry to Investigation We also reported today that the SEC has opened a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and were previously the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry. This is not unusual and we welcome this investigation and are confident that this matter will finally be put to rest. With so much publicity surrounding our company right now, I want to ask you to keep in mind that not all media reports are accurate or even based on factual information. We are committed to communicating updates to you every day by voice mail, e-mail or both, so that you know the factual status of our company's situation. We have created an Enron Updates Intranet site (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>) to keep you apprised of current events. Please check back frequently for information and new developments. I truly thank you for your continued hard work and support of our company.	1
Natural Gas Origination	Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers. In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Jeff McMahon Named CFO	Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.	1
Ken Lay Resigns from Board	Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors. His resignation is effective immediately. In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization. Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal." He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."	1
Associate / Analyst Program	After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy. I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program. We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program. As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called "PACE", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs. Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron. I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings. The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks. As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program. New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring. The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success. I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.	1
Schedule 1 Fee Changes	At Friday's NYISO Management Committee meeting, two proposals were approved= that will affect next year's rate schedule 1 charges. The first involves t= he assessment of regulatory fees charged by FERC for its electric industry = costs. As you are aware, effective next year, FERC will be changing the way= its electric program costs are assessed to market participants. Under the = new method, a unit charge will be assessed against public utilities providi= ng transmission service, including ISOs. NYISO estimates an annual assessme= nt of $4-6 million. These fees will start to be recovered through the rate = Schedule 1 charge effective January 1, 2002. This should equate to roughly = $0.03 per MWH. The second item approved at Friday's meeting concerned the p= roposed 2002 budget for the NYISO. Total costs will be increasing roughly $= 12 million, which will raise the schedule 1 charges for running the ISO (cu= rrently $0.60 per MWH) by $0.03 to $0.05 per MWH, depending on the size of = the proposed contingency fund that may be included by the Board. Offsetting= these increases is the elimination of a $0.30 per MWH charge that has been= collected during most of 2001 to create a $50 miilion working capital fund= . The ISO expects to achieve full funding of this fund by the end of the cu= rrent year.	1
Message from Ken Lay	Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately. To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company. Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees. The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy. This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations. I truly believe Enron can and will survive. I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does. During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity. I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community. Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here. Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years. Ken Lay	1

Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy	Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties. Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own. We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build. Following are the major components of the transaction. Deal Terms -- The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share. For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing. -- ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger. Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas. -- Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. -- The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year. Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary. Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO. I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman. Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes. Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman. Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron. Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration. The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined. The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002. This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers. As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company. We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions. Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations. I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible. As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history. We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses. I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps. We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>. If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>. We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions. If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670. I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company. Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience. Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse. And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

Stay in Touch	I'm still holding on by a thin thread here in Portland, but I wanted to send you my vitals as I'm experiencing advanced symptoms of the travel bug. Needless to say, you're one of the major reasons I have no regrets about having worked at Enron. Definitely stay in touch.	2
Re: City of Mesa - gas supply	The City of Mesa is in receipt of your email confirming Enron's lack of gas scheduling for Mesa for December 6, 2001. Based on that email of December 5, 2001, Mesa must find an alternate gas supplier in order to meet Mesa's present and future gas needs. Thank you for your assistance.	2
Citizens 11/01	I tried to find Mara Bronstein in the address book, but I could not find her name. I'm hoping you can help me. Do you know if there is a Griffith spreadsheet for Nov? My last day with Enron is next Thursday and I'm trying to complete Citizens before I go.	2
RE:	Please contact Megan Parker from now on for Citizens. I will be helping transition this off to her, but most of the activity needs to be addressed with her.	1

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. is= n't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors = are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could ba= rgain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal.=20 Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cros= s-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10= .85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agree= ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan= tially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.= trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen= ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe= r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40. Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under= the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem= ent with Enron contains a broad "material adverse change" clause as well as= some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20 Dynegy officials performed "due diligence" throughout the holiday weekend, = seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe= red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that= some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved= assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh= ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio= n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an "= accounting error" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O= ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning= s.=20 An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the= deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw= o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi= sions "are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share= holders." Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen= t.=20 Clauses related to a "material adverse change," also known as a "material a= dverse effect," have been the focus of much attention among merger professi= onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e= conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi= tions.=20 But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c= onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan= t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and = groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to = envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20 Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t= hat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces= sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea= t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IB= P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa= ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the = accounting issue.=20 In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E= . Strine Jr. wrote that " . . . the important thing is whether the company = has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat= ions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia= lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat= her than months."=20 That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp= ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh= ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han= dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou= ld qualify as a "material adverse change," or MAC.=20 A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change = is "whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is= it just a hiccup," says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq= uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that = a court "may be skeptical" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agree= ment disclosures were a surprise.=20 The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith= er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst= antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su= ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million "topper fee" to Dyneg= y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20 Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces "pending or threatened" litigation= liabilities that are "reasonably likely" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos= e liabilities hit $3.5 billion "an Enron material event will be deemed to h= ave occurred," presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s= ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20 Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that loss= es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e= vent. The liability must result from litigation.

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe= r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor= e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair= man David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin= g for more oil and gas.=20 Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company= . Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's = planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is= making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing = business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy= and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh= ile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation= s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear= nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a= nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co. The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming= a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o= il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che= vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which= should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No= wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have= margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth= er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20 Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak= e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th= ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has = sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha= s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.= =20 Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro= nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Re= illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat= ural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its fina= nces, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat= back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro= sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn= ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20 Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C= EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay = didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th= e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans= wer could be: Bail us out. So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown = Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co= ffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 = p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a= nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi= llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t= o the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up= Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne= gy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20 Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1= 00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says = that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``= I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be= en incredible to watch.''=20 Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye= t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2= 00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts = of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control= an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now= .=20 That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading= operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company= to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo= rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel= ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert= ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap= er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2= 000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul= d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc= h Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc= ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc= h as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, = says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge= t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi= ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind= ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav= e the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim= ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e= xceed $3.5 billion.=20 Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not= a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati= on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l= ooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it = was.''=20 But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting= tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t= icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1= 997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part= nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is= still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of = weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n= ecessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities= Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everyth= ing of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive ear= nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou= rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And = Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it= s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are m= ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss= ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s= hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach= ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag= ement job with the new company.=20 Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin= g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclip= sed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit.= ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been = at the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M.

All Rights Reserved. =09 Cover Story CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do-= -and what investors need to know By Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20 With Mike McNamee in Washington 11/26/2001 BusinessWeek 76 (Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.) In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard= to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y= ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year= , the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t= hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It= was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had= announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide= ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma= nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex= clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a= billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's= net worth.=20 Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho= rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b= ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o= ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory= that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if = companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char= ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s. Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu= e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than = the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve= n the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac= tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market= s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t= he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place = to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation= s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc= k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co= uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish= ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s= ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of = the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20 Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable = decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos = results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the= ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an= d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet= y of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers= ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen= t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne= t income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to = answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20 Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb= ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are= woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co= mpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,= and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh= o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac= counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of = noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of = those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa= nce of ongoing operations.=20 That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc= ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co= mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain= ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says= Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC = is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and = perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20 What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an= d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in= vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne= t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe= r. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In = early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta= llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S= tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul= d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa= rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20 ``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h= as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of= hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin= gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to= evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w= e better all know what we're looking at.''=20 Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen= erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street= is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea= rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10= .78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First= Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t= he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com= panies.)=20 The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use= First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively = modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin= g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20 How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating= operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more = or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc= reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn= ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv= entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th= ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a= llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo= rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter= within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, = the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&= P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pr= o forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo= rs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t= he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired= KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''= =20 That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end= ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e= arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco= mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib= le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' in= cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette= r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges= ,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab= les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20 Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi= ng out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me= asure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal = is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th= ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat= ing earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity = and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a= s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and= investors are free to ignore everything else.=20 There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion = asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne= ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif= .) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor = SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as= sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS = and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in= to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp= ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an= d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net= income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi= ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past = five years added up to only $5 billion.=20 Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-= off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of= hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch= arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de= scribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R= . Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal= ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i= s going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers= analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-= -a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo= rs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to = eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati= ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs= of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev= erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o= f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme= nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of= an asset.=20 When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe= nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group= included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G= AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c= ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent= s.=20 The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F= inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman = Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo= rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends = to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In= 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char= ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. = In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo= r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it = still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an= other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru= les.=20 The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden = changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac= ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul= es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co= mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So= GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan= y's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost= s out in their unaudited press releases.=20 Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin= g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft= ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a= re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro= wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide= missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char= ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while = investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd= ay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20 The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char= ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di= stort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in= to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu= ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur= chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven= tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p= rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the= se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the= ir pro forma calculations.=20 Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part = of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo= ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s= hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the = Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f= ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it = was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. = Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh= olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c= an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera= ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po= ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, = tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains= in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in= its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom= e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer= maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell = spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b= reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In= our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t= here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special= charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve= stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in = the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.= 12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,= and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten= tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are= another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to= customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo= ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating= its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking= sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame= the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are= n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic= s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis= hed into write-offs.=20 Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e= xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin= gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c= harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos= t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take= n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni= ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area = that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite= a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they= can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s= ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20 Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the= m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi= sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge = of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared = with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20 Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for = example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor= mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep= ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the = Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim= e events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, = Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that = in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf= ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a= re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy= doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch= anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re= flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl= e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie= s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value= falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem= ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t= o take more charges.=20 But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t= here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v= aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. = ``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com= ing up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe= ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20 While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam= es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d= ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate = investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``= funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to= plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB= Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF= O is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than= another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20 There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re= store GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl= ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income= from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s= ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they= bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their= press releases with the SEC.=20 At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma = numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num= bers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment= of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio= n is more important to investors. High-Gloss Glossary Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin = on their results. Here's what those terms mean: DEFINING EARNINGS: NET INCOME The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA= P). Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie= s & Exchange Commission accepts in its filings. OPERATING EARNINGS An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela= ted to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it= is not an audited figure. CORE EARNINGS Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar= e calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the preparer wishes. PRO FORMA EARNINGS The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime= s excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest. EBITDA Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely quoted. ADJUSTED EARNINGS A new term for pro forma. DEFINING COSTS: SPECIAL CHARGES A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections. ASSET IMPAIRMENTS Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it= s current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern= al venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at inflated prices. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset= s acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o= f a change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value= s. RESTRUCTURING RESERVES An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down= a portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an= d if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed. WRITE-DOWN Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos= t long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash costs, such as investment-banking fees.

That's the most basic question an investor can e= ver ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year= s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C= orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta= ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the = New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit= ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu= ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin= g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co= rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a = clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo= rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the= global marketplace (page 76).=20 The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou= sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m= odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense= s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree= t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth= od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f= rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos. A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA= AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti= me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o= perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there= are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res= ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5= 00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s= tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA= P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20 The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. = It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings = and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc= y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek= ) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea= rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown= s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge= r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,= and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b= uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many= investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has= shown remarkable resilience.=20 Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert= s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep = their wits about them. In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o= f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera= ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista= kes they should avoid.=20 Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20 In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi= nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's per= ceptions about risk have changed?=20 I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th= e risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing = in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua= tions]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20 So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove= r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d= arned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock a= n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20 What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? T= hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh= anistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in = the markets?=20 I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W= e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin= g is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this co= untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th= e strength of our government.=20 There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've h= ad many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about a= ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret= ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't ge= t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully= before the economy goes up.=20 There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resourc= e and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20 What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past = two or so months?=20 They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn= 't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After = Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20 Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going= to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o= f fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: "Thi= s is still the time to invest."=20 My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, "I just don= 't want to be in the stock market at all." And it's just the time that peop= le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20 Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post= er child of the last cycle. Or people say, "I'll get back in [the market] w= hen I see the economy turn around." Well, by the time they see that, it's t= oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Times Says 2001-11-26 07:36 (New York) Washington, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is examining Dynegy Inc.'s proposed acquisition of rival energy seller Enron Corp. for possible antitrust violations, the Los Angeles Times reported. The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's electric grid, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy and other major power sellers, including Mirant, and AES Corp.'s Williams Cos., from selling electricity at market prices in the state, the Times said. Throughout the state's power crisis, Governor Gray Davis and other officials accused Dynegy, Enron and other power companies of withholding electricity and manipulating the cost of wholesale power to gouge consumers, the Times said. Enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure $9.15 billion in debt. ``I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust implications would consider this one carefully,'' California State Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat, told the Times. ``If anything, Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to manipulate markets than it was before.''

James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.= =20 As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man= agement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclos= ure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over = a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its sh= are value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) = investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest repor= ts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong? No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, = Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsew= here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance a= nd general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures woul= d make an excellent case study!)=20 But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with= out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b= illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th= e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche= d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv= olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other = senior officials were sacked.=20 Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, redu= cing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil= ar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.=20 It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr= ading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These compri= sed private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was= kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To= this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron= itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed th= reshold(s).=20 All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and = mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu= ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf= fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi= s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ= e accounting genius.=20 Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over t= he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th= e company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million= as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.=20 The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the E= nron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit tha= t at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, b= alance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o= ut, but what has come out is bad enough.=20 But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi= on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra= nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron.=20 Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lack= ed transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was= always somewhat fragile?=20 But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity = analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin= g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw= are of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management agg= ressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified = the spirit of the times trading assets was what the "masters of the univers= e" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The = Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a= ctivity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming= that "we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopo= lies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world.= " (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's = inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).=20 For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that "= Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec= hnologies and physical technologies", bringing derivatives theory to tradin= g in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has= not led to more sober management of trading risks.=20 Surely the role of "markets" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, be= tween producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse= in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forg= et this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether i= n the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, gre= ed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a = little bit to the left? Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power, India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. The project is mired in a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't been paid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only customer, for eight months. ``One more bidder will increase competition, which is welcome. ``Any step in the national interest is good. ``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since we want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a reasonable price. ``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enron stake until the legal wrangles are solved. Once that's cleared, then we will try and clear the proposal quickly.'' --Gautam Chakravorthy in the Mumbai newsroom (91-22) 233-9027	1
