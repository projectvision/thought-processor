RE: OUTSTANDING COUNTERPARTIES	I also noticed on Inland Paperboard and Packaging, Inc./ENA, CP #66189, we are still waiting for the executed agreement since July 10th.

RE: Enron October Invoices	Megan, I'm sorry for the delay... I've been working hurriedly on the Colorado invoicing first as I've been directed.

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager: 1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). or 2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop (stand alone computer). Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field. If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you. Thank you, Dan Diamond	2

Exotica add-in	Andy, Just finished meeting with Nelson from gas fundies and Martin Lim from power fundies to discuss getting the Exotica libraries migrated ASAP. The best I can get from them is "hopefully tomorrow" as far as a date for migration. They are dealing with the validation of calculation routines between the UBS libraries and the Exotica libraries since Exotica will play a role in pnl calculation. I will follow up on this again tomorrow. I told them that "hopefully tomorrow" was not the answer I was looking for so I would help out in any way. They recognize that we need these libraries loaded on our machines regardless of their validation. Also, Nelson showed me a list of the products that are scheduled for 'day 1' and power options are not on that list. There are a lot of people working with that list to prioritize support so this is just a heads up for you. Later. Rob	1
