P&L estimates	Good morning, In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings. I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them. This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate.	0
