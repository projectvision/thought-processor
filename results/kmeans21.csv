Dynegy Discussions	Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies. As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron. This is just one of several options that we are considering. Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy. We have no additional information we can share at this time. We'll keep you updated as developments occur.	2

TEKsystems	Michelle- Good morning, and I hope that this e-mail finds you well. The reason for my message is to follow-up with you regarding the conversation myself, Darlene Donlan, and Greg DeLuca from our organization had with you a few weeks back. We had discussed making additions to the Enron master PWD and getting copies of Enron's Code of Ethics, background check requirements, and Enron's benefits package regarding the indemnification clause. Darlene, who is one of TEKsystems' Controllers, sent to your attention a copy of the revised PWD with payment terms and TEKsystems' services, and Mark has been working and communicating with myself regarding the other requested information. I just wanted to follow-up with you to see what additional steps, if any, that TEKsystems may need to take in order to continue moving forward in the contract execution process. If there is any additional information you may require of us on our end, please let me know and I will be happy to help assist in any way possible. I know that you are extremely busy, and that you probably have other, more pressing matters to spend your time on. Any feedback you could provide would be appreciated and most helpful. Thank you once again for your time and consideration, and I look forward to your response.	2

Summer Associates from UT School of Law	Dear General Counsels: On Monday, May 21, 2001, our two summer associates, Chike Okpara and Reginald Sewell will begin their summer rotation program with Enron. As you know, both of these gentlemen have just completed their first year of law school at the University of Texas School of Law. Our summer program is for twelve-thirteen weeks beginning on May 21, 2001 and ending on August 17, 2001. Since school begins on August 20, 2001, I anticipate that each student may wish to end his rotation during the week of August 13, 2001, thus leaving time for a brief vacation to be taken before school starts. Mr. Okpara's rotations are: May 21, 2001 through June 15, 2001 Corp. Legal/ETS Legal Dept. June 18, 2001 through July 13, 2001 Enron Global Finance Legal Dept. July 16, 2001 through August 17, 2001 Enron Wholesale Services Legal Dept. Mr. Sewell's rotations are: May 21, 2001 through June 15, 2001 Enron Global Finance Legal Dept. June 18, 2001 through July 13, 2001 Enron Broadband Services Legal Dept. July 16, 2001 through August 17, 2001 Enron Energy Services Legal Dept. Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell will attend New Hire Orientation on Monday, May 21, 2001. I will be at New Hire Orientation to meet and greet them. I will also present the Enron Code of Ethics. New Hire Orientation ends at noon. Following New Hire Orientation, I will take Mr. Okpara and Mr. Sewell to lunch. I anticipate introducing them to their first respective rotations at 2:00 pm on Monday, May 21, 2001. I have sent their resumes to you under separate cover. Thanks so much for your participation in this program. Please call me at 713-853-7224 if you have any questions.	2
Analyst & Associate Program - Summer Interns	I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high stakes activity this is for Enron. Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our efforts. Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671). We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron.	1
Re: Out of Office AutoReply: Outsourcing deal lawyer	James: I hope you were not offended when I wrote to you directly several weeks ago (without introduction) about my hopes to talk to you about a transactional lawyer position on your team. Might you need another hardworking, big firm trained lawyer with lots of complex outsourrcing and transactional experience? I think my training and experience would suit me well to hit the ground running. I would be thrilled with the chance to talk. Let me know and I can resend my resume. Look forward to talking soon.	1
Potential Corporate Legal Position	Gentlemen: It is my understanding that Ann Ballard will be leaving Enron soon. As a result of her departure, it is also my understanding that a new position may be created to handle federal compliance that would encompass matters related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Federal Power Act. If so, I would like to be considered for the position. I have attached a copy of my resume below. I hold a Doctor of Jurisprudence from the University of Houston. While in law school I received an honors grade in Legal Research and Writing. Additionally, I possess an excellent command of the English language. I have approximately ten years of legal experience in the judicial, firm, and corporate environments. My experience includes preparation of documents for all phases of litigation from pre-trial through the appellate level, administration and drafting of natural gas contracts, administration of all contracts related to the acquisition of water and wastewater facilities on a worldwide basis, and monitoring asset compliance requirements. Currently, I act as a point of reference to various disciplines such as legal, tax, accounting, asset management, and restructuring. I also utilize the Secretariat database in my day-to-day activities. I possess extensive oral and written communication skills as a result of working in various legal environments. I am comfortable working with employees across all levels of Enron. During my tenure at Enron I have worked on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Annual Report of Interlocking Positions filing. This report is mandatory under Section 305(c)(1) of the Federal Power Act. Further, while at Texaco, I prepared the Canadian National Energy Board's monthly report for the export of natural gas from Canada and the U.S. Department of Energy's quarterly sales and price report for the import of natural gas from Canada. Please keep my inquiry regarding this position in confidence. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Monique V. Shankle Enron Corp.	0

Quicksilver Resources	Ken and Jeff: Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine. Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver. Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK). Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron. Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today. Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering. I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding. If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board. However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron. As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry. I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility. Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position. Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further. Thanks. Jim Hughes	2
-	Jim, I promised you some contact details. Although I'm a little late with formal notification, as from the beginning of the year I joined Societe Generale on a part-time basis. I'm a Senior International Adviser which means I do pretty much anything I want to turn my hand to. Jay Worenklein, who's the Global Head of Project Finance in New York, is an old friend and we have always said that it would be fun to work together if the opportunity ever arose. In parallel with the SG role, I am continuing with the two roles for the British Government I had previously mentioned to you: as adviser to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport on the use of private finance in the transport sector, and as non-executive Deputy Chairman of Partnerships UK, the new merchant bank cum project developer the Government has formed to take forward its well-known private finance programme. So you can see that I've finally ended up with the sort of portfolio we were discussing last fall. Contact details are as follows: Mobile 44 7802 655 605 At Partnerships UK 44 20 7273 8341 (direct) 44 20 7273 8357 (my personal secretary - Carole James- who can usually be relied upon to know where I am) 44 20 7273 8383 (switch) 44 20 7273 8367 (fax) e-mail: adrian.montague@partnershipsuk.org.uk At Societe Generale 44 20 7676 6821 (direct) 44 20 7676 6881 (Nicola White - who tends to now where I am when I'm at SG, or is a good point of call if Carole is not there) 44 30 7676 6000 (switch) 44 20 7667 2487 (fax) e-mail: as above Since I move between offices a fair amount, if you send an e-mail, it's best to send to both addressed at once.	2
Joe Hubach of Texas Instruments	David and Jim: I spoke with Joe Hubach today and he is very interested in becoming a part of the new Tech Law Center. Joe is expecting your call, Jim, and David you might want to follow up and invite him to lunch. He said he would do his best to attend the ICLC Advisory Board meeting and the Symposium this year, too (no doubt mainly to hear Jim's talk!) His contact information is as follows: Joseph F. Hubach Senior Vice President and General Counsel Texas Instruments Incorporated 12500 TI Boulevard MS 8658 Dallas, Texas 75243 Tel: 214.480.6030 e-mail: j-hubach@ti.com Assistant: Carla Morey Let me know if we can provide you with any additional assistance in this regard. Best regards.	2
Ernst & Young	A friend of mine, Jim McCloskey, a Director at Ernst & Young, mentioned to me that one of his partners and former Vice Chairman of E&Y, Bob Herdman, was recently named Chief Accountant to the SEC and asked whether E&Y could be of any assistance with respect to the present SEC inquiry. I told Jim that I would convey his request to the appropriate personnel. If you or any one wanted to discuss this matter further with Jim he can be reached at 713-750-8206. I do know that Jim had met with Jeff Skilling earlier this year to talk about opportunities in E&Y working with Enron and I think he has another meeting scheduled in November with Rick Causey and others for a follow up presentation, all unrelated to the SEC inquiry. Regards, Scott Dieball	2
Bankruptcy Management Committee	In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.

If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated. All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors. Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.	2

Microsoft	Microsoft's in-house counsel called me on my cell phone a few minutes ago. He just wanted to let me know that they received our proposal this morning and that they have retained Preston Gates & Ellis LLP to assist them in reviewing and analyzing our proposal. He said they would be getting back with us shortly -- hopefully tomorrow -- and said that his business folks where intent on moving "forward instead of backward," whatever that means. Talk to you soon. Andy	2

SEC inquiry regarding hedging through limited partnerships	You may recall that I flew in from San Francisco to meet with you last September to interview for an attorney position to work on the commoditization of broadband. You were interested in me because I had traded futures as a broker prior to my career as a lawyer. I was sorry to hear through a headhunter that Enron had disbanded the group. (Robbi, I hope that you recovered from your house fire.) To cut to the chase, I have read in the news about the SEC investigating Enron and its derivatives trading with two of its LP's, which I gather was extremely profitable. I wondered if there was an opportunity to finally work for Enron. I understand how swaps work, have conducted financial investigations and have securities litigation experience, albeit all on a smaller scale than you are operating on. I have gas swaps experience as a lawyer at TransCanada Energy Ltd. I worked for the Alberta Securities Commission assisting them in an investigation into a market manipulation. I also used to sue the major brokerage houses on a contingency basis for outrageous acts committed by their brokers when I had my own practice. I have been looking for an opportunity to work with swaps and specialize in the law with respect to derivatives. I am available immediately and would be willing to work on a contract basis. If you think that I could help, my number is 403-241-7293.	1
FW: Career Opportunities at Enron	FYI re my voice mail to you. Jim -----Original Message----- From: pincussr@nmenergy.com@ENRON Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 2:04 PM To: jderric@enron.com Subject: Career Opportunities at Enron Dear Mr. Derrick: Les LoBaugh suggested that I contact you to inquire about an in-house counsel position at Enron. I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk Holding's unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to close in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business units may occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing other career opportunities. I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron because of my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General Counsel for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and the energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and negotiating gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and related documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions, including physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor and I am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in the energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related energy industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy Marketers Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also responsible for representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes utility regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with corporate mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee issues, interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and secured transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation and real property matters. I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Steven R. Pincus	0
Jeff Huff Resume	The resume for Jeff Huff was inadvertently dropped from the message we sent yesterday evening. The resume is attached below for your convenience. Below are a few points for your review: Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been a consultant dedicated to Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support. The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. Thank you. Mike and Jeff	0

Important Message	It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall. I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts. As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself. Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease. Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year. JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research. Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help. Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place! We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal. The theme for the walk this year is "Mission: Possible" and we would like to have you join us for this great event. The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it. If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below. If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week. In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer. Thank you very much for your support.

Calif.'s Energy Future	Dear Ken, I hope you 'visit' with the Governor was as fruitful as mine. we are very favorably supported in our development of a Regional Energy Efficiency Initiative ... an approach to defining and delivering sustainable energy efficiency. (not conservation!) There is an opportunity to discuss a way in which Enron could perhaps become involved in a very significant set of new developments within the sphere of influence in which I operate. If you wish to 'look into' this .. let me know. I believe such an endeavor during this difficult time might well stand you in good stead .. and its a way to enter the end use services business. I look forward to getting to Aspen for the AI conference. John	2
Speaking Invitation	Dear Mr Lay Eyeforenergy Asia 2001 takes place at the Shangri La Hotel in Singapore, 15-17 October. It is the follow-up to last year's e-Business for Energy Asia Pacific, which also took place in Singapore, and will be the meeting-place this year for the senior energy executives in the region to discuss all the latest developments in the industry - e-business, regulatory change, and the subsequent financial impact on both the new and old economies. I would like to invite you to give a keynote presentation at the conference. I have attached the full program. We expect 150 very senior delegates from across the energy industry, from Asia and beyond - oil and gas co's, but also electricity utilities, as well as exchanges, analysts and investors. Speakers will come from companies such as Caltex, BP, Shell, Petronas, Premier and Texaco, and, hopefully, Enron. If you have any questions at all, or would like to discuss your presentation in more detail, please do not hesitate to give me a call or drop me an email.	0
Three proposals, following up our recent meeting.	Dear Dr. Lay, We met less than a week ago, on Wednesday 16 May 2001, during the OECD Forum 2001 in Paris. I'm an independent consultant and innovator, with a special interest in energy and new technologies. I have more than ten years experience in research and innovation in economics, business and technology. I attended the session on energy you chaired during that OECD Forum. After the session, I had a discussion with you. Unfortunately, your time was too short. You gave me your card and asked me to write you. As I told you, I think I can add value to your staff, bring new lines of businesses to Enron and with them, many new clients. And above all, unprecedented profits. I am writing you to propose my contribution in these purposes. I'm mainly making three proposals to Enron. 1.- Working for Enron as an external consultant. Here, I would rather like to work on assignments, medium or long term, with a preference for the following jobs: risk assessment and/or management, strategic analysis on geopolitical, macroeconomics and societal issues. I think these are important tasks for a company like Enron. The current problems with Enron's Dabhol power plant in the Maharashtra state in India stresses the kind of importance I'm mentioning. I can also conduct surveys and provide Enron with technical and fruitful information and policy recommendations. I've done a job like that recently, on the oil-pipeline project in Chad and Cameroon. As you may already know, this is a $4 billion project recently launched, with the support of the World Bank, and led by three major energy firms: Exxon and Chevron of the USA, and Petronas of Malaysia. I wrote a detailed and long report, which combined public and private sectors' concerns, and also communities' interests. Having operations worldwide, Enron I think needs the type of technical works I've done on that major energy project. I have a good expertise in energy economics. I attend international congresses on that subject, for instance in Boston in January 2000. Since more than five years, as a journalist or as an independent consultant, I have been covering the works and studies of, or participated to workshops and seminar organized by, the IEA (International Energy Association). I know Mr. Robert Priddle, IEA chair, who also attended that energy session during the OECD Forum 2001. I know the work he and his team of experts have been doing. 2.- Being fully employed by Enron. In this respect, I would prefer to work as a researcher for either Enron Project Development and Management or Capital and Risk Management departments. In these fields, I've also innovated. I've created among concepts, tools and processes. For instance, the "Sensible Guide for Action". This is a tool theoretically powerful and practically very efficacious. It's main goal is to help decision-makers, in both private and public sectors. The Sensible Guide for Action assists them in their approach to solve technical problems. The SGA is a five-leaf bough. I've also created a method to assess a firm capacity to create wealth. This method can be adapted to fit some particular projects. The method is very useful in countries where there's no stocks market, and where capital markets are not sufficiently large. That's the case of underdeveloped countries in general, where yet the energy demand if forecast to grow the most in the coming decades. Enron cannot overlook this, or miss the business and profit opportunities in this growth. 3.- The Business of Businesses. Dear Dr Lay, if you accept this third proposal, it will probably be the best investment Enron has ever made. I'm an independent researcher and entrepreneur, with a strong quantitative analysis competence, and a multidisciplinary background, both by education and professionally. I'm a graduate in mathematics and in mechanical engineering (University of Paris) and also in business and economics (Institut d'Etudes Politiques of Paris). In this third proposal I'm bringing to Enron two key inventions I've made, two types of financial products targeting consumers and companies. I believe they will interest Enron. These products have a market potential worldwide, unlimited. They will create an entirely new industry: the business of businesses. I'm currently looking for investors with whom I can launch those products. We will be the world leader here, and remain in that position for a long time before copycats try to reach us. I've created the products, and nobody knows about them or about their extraordinary markets. I started to talk to you about these products when we met, but you were hurrying, and the many solicitations and noises of the Forum made it difficult to explain my point. I'm writing you as you asked me, because firstly I believe these products will interest Enron. Secondly I know how these products will boost three types of Enron services: Online Marketplace; Broadband Services; and Energy & Commodities. Plus, these products, and the business of businesses they create are an excellent placement for Enron. Among the many reasons why I believe my products will interest Enron are these: (i) Their market is global. (ii) They are directly related to consumption and savings. (iii) They're excellent saving vehicles, for instance for pension or life insurance. (iv) They concern payment transactions and transmissions (And thanks to information technology, costs here decrease while productivity will grow). (v) They are both offline and online business (These products will be excellent for Enron e-business). (vi) I want to be and remain a global leader. (vii) The products' growth potential is borderless (viii) There's no competitor and before copycats arrive we would have strongly imposed ourselves as The Leader and the Reference, increasing chances that customers remain faithful to us. (ix) My products will allow Enron to beat its competitors. (x) Enron will earn a lot of revenues, many new clients, and very big and unprecedented profits. I'm looking for investors willing to put around $7 million. Given that the revenues generated can very rapidly reach the range of $500 million to $1 billion, that initial $7 million is a wise and very profitable investment. If you're interested, I'm ready to present the products and its business scenario to you. The business model is very innovative, unprecedented. These products' market is the whole world. But the first three markets I would like to attack are the UK, Germany and moreover, Japan. Today's news about Japan is rather bad. Economists and many observers see a declining Japan. Me not. They may be right from a pure statistical and macroeconomic viewpoint. But they fail to see deeper. They overlook the other face of Japan. For my part, I see great business opportunities in Japan, today and for the coming decade. Particularly for the financial products I'm proposing. These financial products I want Enron to launch with me in Japan, perfectly fit Japanese consumption manners, their problematic pension system, and life insurance structure there. Public pension systems are under pressure every where, particularly in Japan. In Germany they are trying to reform it. But there's no consensus in the governments (federal and states') or in the Parliaments (federal and states'). Last week, Chancellor Gerhard Schr?der won some parliamentary approval. But the package he proposed is far from solving the issue. In the meantime, problems may accumulate, the situation could worsen. What seems sure is that in a foreseeable future, governments, not only in Germany but in all developed and ageing countries, will no longer be able to pay pensions at the level they have promised or are continuing to promise. An additional bad news, even company pensions will suffer. In today's "Financial Times" (Tuesday 22 May 2001, page 17), Peter Thompson, incoming chairman of the British National Association of Pension Funds "warned UK workers that they would no longer rely on comfortable company". He adds that "many wold have to work until they were 75 -- 10 years longer than the current retirement age - if they wanted to enjoy a financially comfortable old age". Therefore, workers and citizens should start, right no! to save for themselves. My products are here the best saving vehicle I know. And to what I know of Enron, it seems to me that Enron's shareholders also will appreciate the kind of new business and investment opportunity I'm bringing to their company. They will allow Enron to create a new and unprecedented business model that all its competitors will envy. In a way, Enron will change for its advantage, the way to do business in general, and energy business in particular, thanks to the "business of businesses" concept I've elaborated. Dear Dr. Lay, as I read in Enron's web site, the list of awards you have received: impressive. Congratulations! Two qualities common to all of them are leadership and creativity. I wish these will help you to catch the wonderful opportunity I'm bringing to you, in order to allow Enron to accomplish a phenomenal progress. Leadership and moreover creativity are also two qualities I've been trying to put into practice. This effort creates a sort of affinity between us. Thus, I think we can easily understand one another, speaking in some way, the same language. Hence an additional reason that brings me to write you and to make my proposal directly to you. Given what I've learned of Enron's vision and values, I would like to stress four of the twelve headings that are listed in Enron "vision and values" page: innovation, diversity, change and excellence. Four headings that are at work in each of the three proposals I've just made to you. When I knew you were coming to that Forum, I prepared some materials for you and was ready to present my proposals to you in details and to answer all your questions. I'm still ready to do it. I'm even ready to come to Houston for that purpose. In one recent Enron's ad, I read : "Enron: Endless possibilities". Let's make it true. Let's do it together. Let's reap the enormous benefits of "The Business of Businesses"! Thank you.	2

Request For Assistance	Mr. Lay: I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping to strengthen a relationship EES has with Sysco Corporation. EES and Sysco began discussing a wide array of business opportunities with one another in the Fall of last year. On June 30th of this year, we entered into a 10 year electricity supply contract for all of Sysco's California facilities. We are currently pursuing two important Q4 transactions with Sysco; an electricity supply contract for their Texas facilities and a demand side management contract for all of their facilities. We had planned to close the Texas supply transaction today. However, in a phone conversation I had this morning with Sysco's Director of Procurement, Terry Taylor I was informed that Sysco's CEO, Charles Cotros has instructed Mr. Taylor not to enter into any further transactions with us "until Enron's financial picture clears up". Mr. Taylor believes that Mr. Cotros' concerns about Enron would be diminished if he received a call from a senior executive at Enron. Rosalee indicated that you and Mr. Cotros serve together on the Board of Directors for the Greater Houston Partnership. Would you please call Mr. Cotros and attempt to assuage his concerns about our financial condition. Mr. Cotros is out of the office until Thursday, November 1st. His direct phone number is (281) 584-1415. His assistant is Andrea Walters and her phone number is (281) 584-1405. Mr. Cotros' biography is as follows: Charles H. Cotros, age 64, has served as a director of SYSCO since 1985. Mr. Cotros has served as Chairman of the Board since July 2000 and as Chief Executive Officer since January 2000. He served as Chief Operating Officer from 1995 until January 2000 and as President from 1999 until July 2000. He has been employed by SYSCO since 1974. Mr. Cotros is Chairman of the Executive Committee and he is also a member of the Finance Committee. Source: Proxy, 9/24/01 Thank you in advance for your consideration and anticipated assistance. Otherwise, please let me know if you will not be able take the action requested and I will initiate an alternative plan. Respectfully, Craig Sutter X 31829	2

-	Dear Ken, It has been many years since we talked. You may remember me as your neighbor in Park Grove many years ago. I have followed your career in all the business publications for many years and have cheered you on with the innovative business model you have constructed at Enron. The reason for my e-mail is to recommend Ginny's brother-in-law, Don Booker, for Employment at Enron. I have known Don since our days at Vanderbilt many years ago. He is a chemical engineer and has been with Scott Paper and with SAPPI, the company that purchased one on their mills in Muskegon, Michigan almost since graduation. He is the pulp and utilities mill manager and has experience in coal, gas and bio-mass co-generation. He will take early retirement from SAPPI soon and is looking to continue his career in the power generation area. Since your company is an innovator in this area I thought you might be able to refer Don to someone in your organization that could be of help. On a personal level, I can highly recommend Don as a dedicated, hard working and intelligent employee with the technical and management knowledge to make good business decisions. We have had many talks over the years about his management philosophy and I have always come away being impressed with both his management and leadership skills. Don conducts himself with a high degree of integrity which is an essential leadership requirement. Ken, as you can tell, I am highly recommending Don for a job at Enron. If you have an opening it would be in Enron's best interests to consider him. If I can be of further help give me a call at (407) 293-4000 or e-mail me at RDF@Finfrock.cc <mailto:RDF@Finfrock.cc> . You can contact Don directly at (616) 846-3177 or e-mail at DBooker@charterMI.net. Thanks for your attention Ken, and congratulations on your impressive story at Enron.	2
Press Release-IntraTel -- Unlimited Long Distance Phone Calls	Hi Kenneth, We are within a year anniversary attempt to arrange a meeting with you and our CEO Jack Nester in order to present Telecompression, and how we can cut "Enron Corp." by hundreds of millions off Long Distance phone bill. The second part of this email is to show how we are advancing toward this "Goal" and asking to allow us this meeting or a conference call with you. Telecompression Technologies announces IntraTel, groundbreaking new 40-1 Telecompression software that dramatically reduces intra-office long-distance phone bills. IntraTel, a revolutionary new 40-to-1 voice compression software solution that could shave millions of dollars off corporate long-distance telephone bills, has just been announced by Telecompression Technologies, Inc. (TTI) California. IntraTel, converts a company's LAN, WAN, intranet or VPN into the most advanced telephony communications system ever available. "For large corporations with multiple offices, campuses, including offices abroad, "this is the communications technology breakthrough everyone's been waiting for. It's easily the most significant cost-savings telecommunications tool of the past 50 years." IntraTel, is unique because of its dynamic bandwidth allocation and an unparalleled capacity of providing toll quality voice with up to 40-to-1 voice compression. It outpaces standard code compressions that can, at best, deliver voice at an 8-to-1 compression. This makes possible a level of compression, which TTI has trademarked as Telecompression, applicable across corporate enterprise networks regardless of bandwidth. "we can do all of this without sacrificing voice quality." IntraTel, which quickly installs on a Windows 2000 network, allows companies to immediately realize savings of thousands of dollars every month for calls to dispersed company facilities and their surrounding area codes. "For very large corporations with staffs and facilities all over the world, savings could easily run into the millions of dollars every year." IntraTel replaces a company's standard telephone communications with network-based PCs on any type of digital network. The company installs the IntraTel Server software on one or more network domain controllers or dedicated Windows 2000 workstations, and individual users can easily download the IntraTel Client software from the network. This gives each intra-company PC user, regardless of his or her global location, access to the program's unique cost-saving benefits and features. The program makes possible extremely high-quality PC-to-PC, PC-to-phone and phone-to-PC connections. It supports 10baseT, 100baseT, and 1000baseT, as well as optical-based networks. PBX features are included to facilitate user transition from conventional Telco-type systems to network-based telephony operations. IntraTel can support up to 65,000 users over a wide area intranet or VPN comprised of either copper, fiber, satellite, wireless or combined system. Other features include phone conferencing for up to eight individuals in multiple locations, whiteboard chat, optional voice mail lobby, text chat, file transfer and save-to-file, and more. Among the many options are IntraTel Phone Jump, which lets any user dial any phone number in an area code in which the company has both an IntraTel Access Server and a connected employee/user. In other words, if your San Francisco office has an employee in London with the IntraTel server and PC software in place, you could call any other phone number in that London area code without paying long-distance phone charges. The new IntraTel Encryption option. This solution gives businesses low-cost capabilities for protecting their worldwide telecommunications. IntraTel Encryption provides the highest level of secure voice, text and data transfer with channel-by-channel encryption. Each company receives and manages its own custom key store, giving it maximum security for sensitive communications."	2

hello stranger	Hello. How's life? Mine is pretty good. I have a face to face interview with Merch Pharmaceuticals. I guess I did ok on the phone interview even though I didn't think they'd call me back. Question for you. I was wondering if you could change the first sentence in my letter of recommendation because it talks about FMLA leave and the dates I worked at Enron, which I have on my resume, but I'd rather they didn't know that I have a little one because I don't want them to judge me by that.. or think I'll be a slacker because I won't, and I already have the same babysitter set up and ready to go. (if I get lucky and get the job)... :) I could come by one afternoon this week to pick it up because my interview is Tuesday. What do you think? No big deal if not, just thought I'd try. Also, I'm taking Emily to Gymboree (a baby class) and Chris Calgar's(spelling???) wife and son are in it. I just met her Tuesday for the first time. I guess they are moving to Houston the end of March. Hope all is well and maybe we'll see you soon. Emily is such a chunk now. Susie Wilson	2
Hi	Rick: Its been a long time and things are coming to their logical end. I thought I would briefly update you on developments here. We are all eagerly awaiting the 19th of November when in all likelihood we would be serving the Termination Notice (TN) to the state government. Thereafter the assets would be transfered to the State Utility and we would want to proceed to London for international arbitration. There may be a few hurdles in the sense that we already have some cases lined against us in various Indian courts. Its not clear if we can proceed as smoothly as the way I have described in the initial lines. We had an all employee meeting , a few days back, and Wade informed us of the recent developments. Post that he did indicate in no uncertain terms the future of all the employees here. Give and take I expect that our services here would be required at max till the time the TN is served, post that our contracts could be severed. Some relocations and some severances have already started and its a matter of time before my turn arrives. I would like to explore possible future employment opportunities under you, in Houston. It would give me immense pleasure if I could in any way continue to contribute to the activities of the division. Any advice from you would boost my morale Warm Regards Ban	2

We understand that the staff in London responsible for these areas are working on a MBO and there is thus little interest from their side to be open or co-operative. This is the reason why I contact you directly and would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience.	2

RE: Conagra is our newest beta customer!	Andy,=20 Nice to meet you over the ether, and I hope we will have a chance to meet w= hen you are next in NY. It certainly sounds like the Fortune 500 represent= a large market with the characteristics you describe. I would guess that = they are somewhat harder to reach and sell than energy firms that are activ= ely engaged in trading derivative products and do regard risk management as= core, whether the system is run internally or accessed as a service. I th= ink the company will have to learn more about what it takes to sell to both= customer segments as it gets started with its sales and marketing efforts,= and I'm not sure any of us know enough about the market at this point to h= ave a strongly held point of view. I would certainly be interested in any = information you have seen as to how the market will develop, and in particu= lar what the breakdown of people trading with Enron as between Fortune 500 = vs. energy industry players looks like. Thanks for your thoughts, and this= is clearly part of an ongoing dialogue with the company as to how to most = effectively design, market and sell its products. Stewart=20	0
Previous conversation....	Andy: It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier this morning. Like I said, I just wanted to introduce myself and see who you might know that would have an interest in ice fishing. Please feel free to contact me personally or you may also pass my information along to anyone that may have an interest. My client holds a strong position in the Northeast. They are looking to fill a Senior Gas Trading position. They are fairly new to the gas world and seeks a professional with a solid understanding of the technical side of natural gas trading. Somebody that is not afraid of taking "responsible" risks. Further information includes: 35,000 megawatts of generation, VAR limit of 25 million The role in general would consist of approximately 35% Strategic Gas Hedging in the Northeast with the remaining balance Spec Trading. This is a Senior Level position so my client is looking for experience as head of a desk. If you have any questions or would like to talk further, please feel free to contact me via phone or email. Thanks, Joel Hagensick	0
