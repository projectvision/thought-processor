Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy	Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties. Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own. We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build. Following are the major components of the transaction. Deal Terms -- The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share. For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing. -- ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger. Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas. -- Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. -- The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year. Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary. Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO. I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman. Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes. Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman. Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron. Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration. The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined. The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002. This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers. As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company. We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions. Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations. I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible. As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history. We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses. I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps. We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>. If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>. We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions. If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670. I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company. Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience. Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse. And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6400, Fax: (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3002. In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.	0
Security Bulletin	The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States. Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001. No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time. The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report. In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges. We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day. In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently. We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.	0
Jeff McMahon Named CFO	Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.	0

Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017). Thank you for your help in this matter.	2

Request for meeting -- Subject: short speech to US Olympic Commit tee 7.16-19.01	Ken, Houston's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games is entering the final phase of the domestic bid process. This summer, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) will conduct initial site visits and evaluations of the eight U.S. bid cities with the goal being to cut the number of cities to three or four. This cut will occur in December of this year. The USOC will be conducting Houston's site visit July 16-19, 2001. This site visit is critical to our ultimate success in bringing the Olympic Games to Houston. Over the four-day period in which the USOC site evaluation team is in Houston, two days will be devoted to venue tours and presentations. There are eight presentation topics predetermined by the USOC, one of which is International Strategy. Simply stated, this is where we show why we think Houston can win on the international level. As a Port Commissioner and a board member of Houston 2012, I will be part of the team that presents this section to the USOC site evaluation team. As arguably the most identifiable international corporate leader in Houston and as the Chairman of the 1990 Economic Summit and the 1992 Republican National Convention, both of which you left with a positive surplus (very important to the Olympics), you are in an excellent position to discuss Houston's international status. George DeMontrond, Susan Bandy (the Houston 2012 Exec Director) and I would very much appreciate 15 minutes or so of your time to update you on Houston's bid efforts and discuss your potential participation in the upcoming site visit. You are our first and only choice, and I'd like the opportunity to show you how important this is for Houston. We expect the number of U.S. bid cities to be reduced to four finalists by this December as a result of these meetings. I will call Rosalee to schedule a time for a visit at your offices. All the best and I look forward to catching up with you soon. I'm attaching my bio, which details the last few years of activity I've been involved with, most of which emanated from your support for me on the UH Board of Regents, the 1990 Economic Summit Host Committee, the 1992 RNC Convention and later the GHP. Thank you for everything you've done for Sarah and me -- hopefully I've reciprocated by doing a good job for you each time. All the best, Vidal	0

Accounting Controls & Procedures Group	One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company. Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective. A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility. Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson. Joining Rick will be Donna Lowry who will manage compliance and records retention controls. To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process. In this regard, your cooperation with Rick and his team is appreciated.	0
New Legal Team to Assist RAC	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader). This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices. The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective. Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities. Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group. Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.	0

Enron Center South Technology Watch	Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk. Turret Users An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication". Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors. While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels. The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment. Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret. The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.
