Dear farging iceholes...	After giving this trade situation WAY too much thought, I have arrived at the following conclusions (giving examples along the way so blockheads like DeFoggi can understand the concepts). 1.) One suggestion is to have the online trading system allow first come, first serve between specified hours/days as allotted by the website. Unfortunately, the reality is that this won't work because there are available free agents on MY team and the only way to add/drop is that I become notified anyway and go in and manually do the transaction and waive the fee. 2.) Power ratings so that the low man on the totem pole gets a chance for first pick. Okay, so a trader makes a bad trade, loses money, gets fired, and then gets the same job trading elsewhere for more money. A loser is a loser and should be acknowledged as such (see Feeley). Those are the breaks in this game. Besides, too time consuming for me to go through the numbers. 3.) Free market... first come, first served, anytime, anywhere. This is a good concept in that those that dedicate the time to watching, studying, and anticipating an opportunity are allowed to seize the moment and get paid. And they should because it is just like a small business, you get out of it what you put into it. Time is money. However, you can't do add/drops once your lineup is set and you should only be able to apply trades to the upcoming week anyways. 4.) Calling two fellow team owners to validate your trade. Really, would you trust Gibby in this situation? I can hear it now, "Oh yeah, dude, I was drinking a soder pop when he called but he neva said anything about picking up that QB." So, I have reached what I call a fair and amicable solution to all of your f*cked up problems. First, the core of someone's team is going to decide the results week in and week out. I've been in this long enough to know that pickups (especially in a big league) are rarely gonna make that big of a difference in the outcome of a season. Past examples include WR Thrash who had a spectacular game against Seattle only to turn around and have a dismal game against the lowly Cowboys. There was $15 given to the pot. What I am getting at is that I think trading is way overrated and only serves to build the pot for the team that drafted the strongest in the beginning anyways. Second, online access allows a level playing field. I agree with this and it should be implemented because it is also time stamped so there is no question as to who was first in a selection. If an owner is going to stoop so low as to change the clock on their computer to try and get an earlier time stamp, then there are bigger mental problems down the road and the money you make off the win should be applied accordingly. Third, my time is just as important and so is a "transaction" period. For example, this weekend is Octoberfest weekend in Fredericksburg. If you think I am going to hang around and stay sober so I can meet your demands and implement your requests, you are sorely mistaken. I fully expect to start drinking myself into oblivion Friday evening and don't expect to come out of my coma until sometime Sunday evening so your changes/requests/questions need to be done by Friday afternoon. SO, here is what I suggest: 1.) to make an add/drop (trade) transaction, click on the "Owners" tab on the league homepage (found up top next to Live Chat), page down to the bottom of the page and send a broadcast email to ALL team members announcing your intentions. I will implement the trade(s) on the Tuesday following the Monday night game. The transaction deadline is Friday 5:00 PM for the weekend games. If I receive the email timestamped before then, I will make the trade for the upcoming weekend. IF there is a Thursday night game, Thursday 5:00 PM is the deadline for THE WEEKEND. At any time after the deadline if a transaction is submitted, it will apply to the following weekend. Also, there will be NO limit on the amount of transactions, feel free to contribute as much as you wish. 2.) regarding current requested trades for the past weekend: for this week only, send ME an email with your request. I will take one trade per team this week only. If two teams want the same free agent, whoever guesses closes to where the Nasdaq composite closes Wednesday, October 3rd wins. The loser will be notified as such. So, BE SURE TO INCLUDE YOUR GUESS. This should provide everyone easy online access to making trades. All you have to do is make sure the free agent is indeed free, that nobody has already sent you an email picking him up, and shoot a broadcast out to the owners proclaiming him as yours. Simple. So, any questions or concerns can be sent back to discuss. I will shoot down all of them. I am going to lunch. I eagerly await the opportunity to tell you why your plan won't work.	2
FW: N. Little Rock Metering	Reagan C. Rorschach Enron North America 1400 Smith Street Houston, Texas 77002 713.345.3363 -----Original Message----- From: Broussard, Richard Sent: Tuesday, October 09, 2001 10:10 AM To: Kroll, Heather; Rorschach, Reagan Cc: Comeaux, Keith; Will, Lloyd Subject: N. Little Rock Metering Below is a summary of the metering issues for N.Little Rock. Entergy is requiring NLR to supply all metering. There are several meters already in place but more are needed. James Bray is the contact with the metering information. All existing meters are pulse contact meters and the metering is brought back to NLR's SCADA system via a radio network. Benton has pulse meters in place but the pulse data is not currently brought back to the SCADA system. For now, meter readers have to go out to each meter with a laptop and tie it into the meter to get readings. The best solution would be to have all of the meters brought back to the central SCADA system. The peak load for NLR is 260MW, the peak for Benton is 65MW. The biggest issue is the generation at the hydro station. There is currently 40 MW of generation from two 20MW units. These units are flow following; the generation is controlled by the flow of water in the river. NLR has no control over the water flow. It is controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. The CoE currently sends out forecasts of water flow but it is not accurate. Right now, the control system at the hydro plant is not connected to NLR's SCADA system. They do have a fiber network in place and the hydro plant can be connected. NLR has to pay Entergy an imbalance charge mostly caused by the change in generation at the hydro plant. Assuming that NLR can get all of the meter data and the hydro plant data back to the SCADA computer, I think that the best course of action for us is to connect a near real-time connection to the SCADA computer to get data back to Houston. This is a system similar to what we installed at Clarksdale. For an estimate of costs, use $50,000 for installation and $1,000 per month for communications. This is for a file server at the site of the SCADA computer with a frame relay connection back to Houston. With this we can monitor the NLR load as well as the hydro generation on a near real-time bases (+/- 5 seconds). James Bray is supposed to call me with more information on the metering and control systems. However, if you get the chance, please try to find out the following information: 1) How many more meters need to be installed? 2) What will it take to get the Benton meters tied back to the SCADA computer? 3) Is there any generation control at the hydro plant or is it totally dependent on water flow? In other words, can they control the pitch of the rotors, open or close valves, divert water, etc. to control the total generation? 4) Less importantly, what type of SCADA system to they have and what is the platform? Platform - Windows NT, Unix, Windows 2000, Windows 95 (Gasp), etc. Software - GE Harris, WonderWare, Intellution, etc. Rick	2
Harassment Training	Michelle - We are getting lots of comments/questions from our employees regarding the mandatory harassment training. Have you given any more thought as to when/how this will be rolled out to Portland and San Francisco? Thanks! Hope that you had a great weekend. Amy	1
Terrorism Audit	Michelle: Here is the first response I received from one of our senior partners in SF: I think the best thing such a client can do is to use a reputable security outfit (such as Kroll Associates) to give the co. a very thorough assessment. I think, quite frankly, that relying on the advice of such an outfit would provide more legal protection than talking to all of the lawyers in the world, although our advice could be an additional benefit. As you know, we have an extensive task force report on workplace violence that would be relevant to this inquiry and could provide the basis for an analysis of this issue, although other areas would have to be explored. I am soliciting comments about the HR consultant you referenced.	1
RE: Revised 9-15-01 Utilization Analysis	Sandra, Thank you for the report. I will discuss these goals with my management team in our staff meeting today. Best regards, Billy	2
Y/E PRC and Contractual Bonus Targets	Michelle, Can you and the comp team help us identify who has contractual bonus targets for performing at the top 25%, 33% or 50% of the PRC "criteria" or "performance scale". Obviously we have a number of contracts we entered into between Jun 99 and the beginning of the end of last year which have some sort of wording along the above lines in them. There are some critical questions I would like to get clarity on: If BU's and support functions simply stop at 10/80/10 in their PRC's how will we deal with these contracts? Presuming all commercial staff are also relative ranked for bonus purposes separately to the PRC, can we use this scale instead (where it will be easier to identify a to half or quartile performance). Do we need to ensure that BU's and Functions that have people with such wording do split their middle 80%. If so how should we do this? Do we need to amend those contracts to wording that is easier to interpret? What proof or disclosure will we need to those individuals with this wording? I have a PRC committee meeting Thurs and while I don't anticipate raising this issue in that forum, I'd like to know we are working on a solution. David	2
Unemployment Question	Hi Michelle, The presentation went as well as it could. There was quite a bit of stunned silence, but the questions are already starting to trickle in. One particular question on unemployment insurance I'm not familiar with, hoping you or Drew can help. Since the VSP is effectively a voluntary election, would employees qualify for unemployment insurance, specifically in New York State. Under the involuntary program, is the severance payment offset by unemployment compensation? You can see where this question is leading, some people may be hedging their bets on the time value of the money. Thanks Cathy Human Resources	2
Management Committee Presentation Draft	Michelle, This is still work in progress. The real work will be articulating the workforce data. Please give me any feedback you may have at this point. I will send more in the am. Thanks for your help. ay	2
Project Fireball (personnel question)	Michelle, The Coal group has a question related to personnel they would acquire from Vulcan if they purchased the marketing rights to their coal. In this scenario, there are 4 marketing employees which would come to Enron as a part of the deal. A few things: In this case, I'm assuming these employees would resign from Vulcan and Enron would extend the appropriate offer. Secondly, Enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an 18mo to 3 year trial period. At the end of the trial period, if Enron returns the marketing rights to Vulcan (or current owner), they want the right to re-call these employees. George McClellan is ok with the right to recall, but I am not sure how/where to put this in writing ie; in the deal agreement, offer letter, etc. Thanks, Shanna	1
RE: Question	My draft response would be: The objective is for BU and Functional leads to identify their top and bottom 10% for discussion surrounding the issues you raise, as well as what the leadership believe is necessary in order to meet their business goals and whether these people could be better deployed in other areas or on other challenges. In relation to promotions, we would expect to see a high correlation between those promoted and those highlighted in the top 10%, however, leadership will review nominations for promotion from both the top 10% and the 80%. As a point of clarification, promotions of non-exempt employees takes place at outside this process and is a matter for the individual BU's leadership and supervisors. David	2
Survey Question Review	Michelle, Our group has been asked by EEL (Liz Barrett) to deploy the attachment survey. We (HRGIM) would like to ensure the language of the survey is consistent with the policies and procedures of Enron Corp. Legal (Jon Chapman) has reviewed the document. Any insight you can provide is appreciated. Regards, Milton P.S. Liz Barrett's comments are below regarding the rationale behind the ethnic descriptions in the survey. "I worked with Jon Chapman on the survey, so it has been comprehensively done over by legal! The reason why I've chosen these categories are that they are the accepted categorisations by the Commission for Racial Equality, who are the governing body on race relations in the UK, and are aligned to their counter-parts in Europe. If we do have a legal challenge, we will be asked to provide data in this fomat, rather than the US descriptors which are not as relevant to the European ethnic profile (for instance 'Hispanic' is not a meaningful category for Europe, whereas it is very significant for the US). I'd prefer to map the US definitions onto the European ones, but to collect the European data in the CRE's format."	1
(no subject)	Michelle, what about including a provision like the following in the Severance Pay Plan agreement of waiver and release? Employee's remedy for a breach of this Agreement by ____ shall be limited to specific performance of ____'s obligations hereunder to make cash payments of the severance benefit described herein, and Employee shall not have a right to any other remedy, including, but not limited to, rescission or reformation of this Agreement.

Re:	As discussed: What happens to my wages/salary if the Company files for bankruptcy protection? The general rule is that a company that has filed a banruptcy petition is not able to make payments on any prepetition debts until a plan of reorganization is filed. However, there are certain exceptions to the general rule. Claims related to wages and salary earned within 180 days of a bankruptcy petition filing (called "prepetition wages and salaries") receive a special priority for upt to $4650 under the bankruptcy code (section 507(a)(3)) and are usually paid in full as part of the plan of reorganization. Most companies that intend to continue operating while in bankruptcy recognize the need to keep employees working and the potential hardship that would occur of wages were not paid or delayed. As a result, most companies that file a bankruptcy petition, but which inetend to remain in business, seek the specific authority of the bankruptcy court to make payments on the priority wage claims immediately so that employees will experience little or no disruption in their wage/salary payments while they continue working. Usually this authority is sought at the same time or shortly after a bankruptcy petition is filed. For a company that derives a great deal of its value from its employees, making sure these payments are made in a timely manner is a high priority.	2

Li Sun	I just got a call from Li Sun. She is expecting to get her H-1 visa anytime, and wants to make sure that she receives it. Should we have her contact Tindall & Foster directly? Also, by law, when an individual on an H-1b visa is terminated, the company is required to provide them a one way ticket back to their home country. Does that still apply in a bankruptcy? If so, who will be handling those arrangements?	1
Rescind Offers/Termination Letters	Tim, (1) We rescinded approximately 8 offers in November. It was decided that individuals who gave up jobs to accept our offer would be paid out one month of salary (with a signed release). I had two people who fell into this category and signed releases but have not received the one month salary. Will they be paid out? (2) I have received several calls from terminated employees concerning the termination letters.

RE: Retention Agreement	Gene, Following our conversation this morning, I would add 2 further points: - John D agreed we could add something to 1b that explains what %age of bonus is paid in rest stock (i.e. 25% with a 25% discount) and it's vesting period. - Additionally, my commercial guys would like to see 10 removed given a perceived overlap with 9.

RE: I am concerned about Networks and NETCO	I suggest we talk first. Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. = The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the= unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally,= people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the e= state which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to spons= or green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the fo= rm of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant. =20 I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as di= fficult as this may be. =20 The main points we need to communicate and build around would be; =20 Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at = least at current levels Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a p= erson as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typica= lly, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the curr= ent have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NE= TCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite th= e same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that= is lost forever. Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enr= on's current arrangement, if we perform. Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of = cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. = This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a com= mitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to rep= ay it. Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each cas= e they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the sp= ecific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting per= iod but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take En= ron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their pl= an requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obvious= ly will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years= in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contr= asted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is the= re a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on ne= gative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too= much innuendo here. VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is a= pparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed l= ogistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these wil= l take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who hav= e VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will = not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the cou= nter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid travel= ing outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be= legit. Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from s= cratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they wil= l support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enro= n estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officia= lly proclaimed. Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although e= ach counter-party has indicated a desire to "normalise" the terms with thos= e of their own company, over time. Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate pla= ns to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective bu= yer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working = assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, w= ill supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that indi= viduals may have had. Specifically, I expect that the new employer will not= honor future equity, cash retention, target bonus or severance provisions = that may be in people contracts. Clearly, there may be some negotiation her= e. =20 Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary review= s, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out= , but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after al= l the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks = in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over= the last 10 years. There may even be an ability to transfer (after a while= to a different part of their organisation, if they have an internal postin= g process). =20 As to process from here, we want to identify those who DON"T want to go and= why. I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an "offer" to switch and NOT accepti= ng it. As I mention above, many of the terms of the "offer" are unlikely to= be a huge surprise, and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch t= hem out now for someone who does want to go. We should have 100% acceptance= , not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early wh= o had concerns, solving them or switching them out for someone else. =20 Jeanie/Amy/Michelle/Neil - looks like we need new updated talking points fo= r all.

Potential HR Matter	Todd Menzing called me up a few days ago to ask if he could send a letter to me about what I understand to be his representation of a former Enron employee against us in an HR matter. I hadn't heard from him, so I followed up today and learned that he had or was going to send a letter to you. Menzing is a former V&E associate. He called me because he knew me from a case in which V&E was representing a party in a commercial litigation matter, and I was representing an Enron employee in a deposition in that matter. Maybe there is an easy, no-brainer answer to what appears to be a potential disqualification issue for both Menzing and his firm (remember the mad cow disease of legal ethics? ) but if you were not already aware of Menzing's prior employer, I thought I'd let you know.	1

RE: Tissue	Dear Ms. Causholli, TAD equals to through-air-drying, a process where hot air is blown in a drum through the paper web and drying it. It allows a higher bulk of tissue paper as the paper web is not pressed hard against iron as in the case of conventional drying. Higher bulk means softer paper and better absorbency properties, therefore it is prefeered by companies aiming at very high tissue quality. I am not a technical expert but machinery manufacturers, especially Metso Paper's Honeycomb division in the USA could explain TAD in more technical terms. AfH stands for away-from-home, i.e. uses in offices, industry, hotels, restaurants, hospitals etc. outside households. I have not yet updated all the 2000 numbers but will do it within the next couple of months. Some data is very difficult to obtain, and thus updating takes a lot of time.	2
Eucalyptus Pulp - Final Note	Martin, Subsequent to my last e-mail I discovered an additional detail which may po= ssibly clarify why ENCE prefers to purchase the Chilean E. globulus species= to the Brazilian species for pulp production. It would appear that the E.= globulus species holds up better than the various Brazilian species during= the refining process. While most papermakers generally don't refine hardw= oods and softwoods with the same equipment, many smaller European mills are= unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingl= y do use a single refiner for all grades. This is particularly true of the= Italian mills. Since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining req= uired for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics (opaci= ty, etc.), these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suit= ed for this type of processing. Accordingly, the globulus species (which i= s also the predominant species in the Iberian peninsula) holds up much bett= er under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus. In any case, I hope this helps shed additional light on this issue, and, as= always, please feel free to revert with any questions you might have. Tha= nks.	1
fiber morphology study	Monika, I found the Jacobs-Sirrine proposal on the fiber study; you can get a copy from me. They included a matrix on which they would display various fiber characteristics, which I'm attaching. Cecil and I went over it and he suggested some changed, which are incorporated here. The only one he wants to add that isn't reflected here---but which we need to tell them---is that we want to know why each quality parameter (the column headings) is important to each major end-use (paper grade) application. Let's go over this Monday morning. Dave	2
FW: FOEX for 11/06	Monika, Good that you put some analysis with the price changes. I'd be a bit careful about declaring that prices are expected to continue increasing through November --- many market observers (particularly Mr. Ross Hay-Roe) believe there's a good chance that the US$15/metric ton increase the producers already received will begin to erode in the next few weeks. I think it's important that we give air time to all the possibilities, especially in light of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the market. Thanks. Karen	2

Re: FW: Newest ASAP from Littler Mendelson	Jim, this is the latest inquiry into the existence of the Employment Practices coverage. You will recall we were trying to maintain on a confidential basis. It is becoming more and more difficult to avoid talking about this insurance as the exposure is often discussed in the press. Do you have any thoughts on disclosure to NEPCO?	2
FW: Weekend Update/Next Week Thoughts	fyi -----Original Message----- From: Cline, Wade Sent: Sunday, May 13, 2001 2:02 PM To: McDonald, Rebecca; Hughes, James A.; Walls Jr., Rob; Lundstrom, Bruce; Ben Glisan@ECT; Dutt, Ranabir; McGregor, Neil Subject: Weekend Update/Next Week Thoughts Here is an update plus my thoughts on what we should consider this week. I hope to be able to discuss this on Monday's call. As this involves some press updates and thoughts regarding the lenders, I am sending this to Ben and Ranabir as well.. I. Press Reports in Weekend Newspapers after Friday Renegotiating Meeting -- reports were mixed on Renegotiation Meeting and possibility of success to find a solution. More Credible papers: Times of India: DPC Phase II should be scrapped, panel tells Enron Economic Times: Enron panel meet fails to make breakthrough; State weighs termination notice to DPC Other papers who follow DPC closely: Financial Express: DPC to meet panel on May 23; Renegotiation is only way out for DPC; Cut in tariff likely Business Standard: Dabhol not averse to tariff renegotiation So the press is all over the map on the outcome of Friday's meeting. II. Press reports from Delhi with GOI reaction: Summary: GOI hopeful that solution can be found between DPC and GOM BUT: GOI makes clear in Sunday papers the GOI position: While GOI not opposed to allowing DPC power sale to 3rd parties, neither GOI nor NTPC will purchase power from DPC. III. MESSAGE TO LENDERS: Lenders want to know we are serious about finding solutions. We are, and are willing to engage in dialogue so long as willing buyers of power are at table. This was made clear in Friday's meeting. But Renegotiating Committee is not serious about realistic solutions. Evidence of this is Chairman's view that DPC (and thus its lenders and shareholders) should get no recovery for the LNG infrastructure. Rather, he strongly believes tariff should be (as reported in Godbole Committee Report) the lowest of any gas-based power plant in country, including those few with pipeline gas. Second, GOI is not serious yet, as they did not even bother to send someone to meeting. IV. STEPS FORWARD (for consideration) A. Issue PTN (whether to do it with or without Transfer Notice to be discussed separately on Monday) B. When PTN issued, press statement to be issued to cover -- after several months of meetings and proposals, no serious response by MSEB, GOM and GOI parties are still not meeting their contractual obligations, even after both Indian and int'l lenders have written to GOI thus we are taking steps to protect contractual rights by issuing PTN Regarding future meetings to discuss project: project was designed as baseload to meet MSEB requirements and approved by GOM and GOI; project must have buyers for power to have serious negotiations Renegotiating Committee position, which is reiteration of Godbole Committee report, is unrealistic If MSEB, GOM and GOI are not willing to meet their contractual obligations to offtake power, then not feasible to discuss any changes to deal; thus prior to any further meetings, DPC awaits specific proposal from MSEB/GOM/GOI on who they propose to substitute for MSEB as the party who is contractually obligated to purchase the power from DPC the prior point is important in that we need to (a) set the going forward agenda with respect to any further meetings and (b) manage expectations regarding such future meetings and who will deliver what proposals, if any (not us). C. Bring in senior management ASAP after PTN Rationale is to both feed our ideas into the GOI as well let lenders know we are committed to finding solution, including bringing our senior management to India for meetings I recommend we bring Ken Lay with Rebecca to meet in Delhi with Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Power Minister, along with Sonia Gandhi. Other meetings can be scheduled as well, and we will want to include some add'l meetings in Delhi and Mumbai. But above are the key meetings. Key message to be delivered -- 2 [or 3] options face the project Terminate, and we are willing to go that route rather than have to invest significant additional money into a project in the India power sector that does not currently work Buyout of foreign debt and equity and allow an Indian solution to be found [Renegotiate on our terms, including GOI taking 2 power blocks and IFIs funding all additional project costs. My earlier e-mail on renegotiation possibilities might provide some ideas here.] The reason I mention this option here is that if we ever think we might have to table a renegotiation option, having Ken & Rebecca do it at the highest level is the way to go. The solution, regardless of which of 3 options will be chosen, must be handled at the highest level, and I think it is now (right after PTN) or never to bring in Ken and Rebecca to see if the solution is there as well as let our lenders know we are seriously taking one more run to try and find a solution. After we bring in Ken and Rebecca, if the GOI still remains on the sidelines and does not step up, the Phase I lenders should realize we have done everything we can and give us the Transfer Notice approval. The quicker we bring in Ken and Rebecca, the quicker we should have the strongest argument for the Transfer Notice approval. One logistical point: I do think it is very important to bring in Ken and Rebecca very quickly after the PTN is issued. But we will need some advance time to set up these high level meetings as well as get Indian approvals to bring Ken's plane into India. This will take about a full business week, so I think we should schedule this trip as soon as we can -- perhaps during week of May 21. D. At same time as senior management comes in, have senior contacts from Wash. DC contact political leaders in Delhi to request a solution be found quickly to avoid any implications on improving India/US relations E. Finally, I also think it is time for Enron to strongly consider an approach directly to some possible buyers. There are 2 Indian corporates who would be leading candidates. There are also some international majors that would be possible. Enron could consider a joint asset package of: DPC Metgas (the TARA is the real value here) Depending on the appropriate Enron internal approvals, 2 other assets could be considered Offshore oil & gas assets Data center On the last 2 items, I know that one of the Indian corporates would be interested in the oil & gas assets, and both would be interested in the data center. We could arrange meetings with senior management of potential purchasers when Ken & Rebecca are in India (or, to avoid press, we might want to schedule these either in low-key India locations or even outside India (Dubai or Singapore)). We can discuss these thoughts on Monday. Wade	2
Teresa Lorraine Simmons v. Enron Corp.	Mr. Derrick, I am directing this email to your attention at the request of Mr. Jim Bouillion for consideration of extending coverage to Enron Corp., pursuant to the EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES LIABILITY ENDORSEMENT on our Directors & Officers policy. We have received a new Petition wherein a former employee of Enron Corp. (former Vice President of Operations for Enron Communications in Portland, Oregon) alleges damages as a result of sexual discrimination and retaliation along with wrongful termination. Suit is filed in Harris County, Texas, with an Answer date of June 18, 2001. Essentially, the Plaintiff claims to have been harassed by Ken Griebling in such a way that he created a "hostile work environment". She filed a complaint with HR and Ken Rice, to no avail. She was later advised her position was being eliminated and that her responsibilities were being assigned to Ken Burroughs, who she had hired and trained. She was in turn assigned to a bandwidth trading floor position with no defined responsibilities wherein she was terminated shortly thereafter under the alleged pretext that her position had been eliminated. Our preliminary review of the Plaintiff's Original Petition (absent any independent investigation or knowledge with respect to her allegations and the valued placed on same-pleadings allege an unspecified amount of damages) suggests there might be coverage for this loss under the Directors & Officers policy. The definition of "WRONGFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE" includes "discrimination" which is defined as both the termination of an employee and the treatment of an employee in disparate manner from other similarly-situated employees in respect to a employee's sex, or in violation of any equivalent protection or rights which may have been conferred on any group or individual protecting them against employment discrimination under federal, state, or local law. Please advise if you would like for us to extent coverage to the named defendant, Enron Corp. According to the information provided, the matter has been assigned to C. Robert Vote of the Litigation Unit. Thanks, Rob Cole, Manager-Claims	2
BoD Comp - Important	Jim - The early estimate of $100,000 was way low and ignored Options. Short answer: Avg. Board fees in 2000 were $79,000 (about 1/3 required to be deferred). Plus avg. phantom stock grant of $53,000 and stock options of $205,000, for total AVG 2000 value of $337000. Obviously big variable is value of options, which are based on a fixed number but a varying Black Scholes value. Paula	2
Securities Litigation -- D & O Carriers	Jim Bouillion of CRM and Gary Cooney of McGriff, Seibels (our insurance broker) asked that I raise three matters with you: 1. Scheduling of a meeting with the D & O carriers' counsel; 2. Obtaining additional D & O coverage; and, 3. Defense counsel selection in light of the possible "advise of counsel" defense and subrogation rights of the carriers. I know that you are covered up, but I would not expect discussion of these issues to take more than 15 minutes. I will wait to hear form you or Steph. Thanks.	2
Residential security	Mr. Derrick, I met with Robert Taylor this week at your residence and had a very productive meeting. One question that came up was the use of security cameras. Areas that we discussed using cameras were: Gate at Larchmont Driveway gate Please let me know if that is something that you are interested in or would like to discuss. thanks Alan	2
Lawyers	Jim, I do not know if Ben or Kristina have counsel or if any other people who are getting worried have made decisions yet but there is a former U. S. Attorney from Omaha, named Ed Warin at the McGrath North firm with whom I've worked who is superb. I recognize that many of the Texas firms may be conflicted and people may not be comfortable with all the Washington, D.C. folks. This guy is an excellent lawyer, knows his way around and is very decent to work with.	2
RE: Possible press release before market open on 11/20/01	First version: First paragraph probably falls under the requirements of SEC Regulation M-A (communications regarding the Enron/Dynegy merger). This could be viewed as soliciting support for the merger ("?merger is in the best interests of shreholders.." etc.). As such, it would have to include the Rule 425 legend and be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 425 (unless you can argue that the reference to the merger is only in a non-substantive way---it doesn't read that way to me). Also, the reference in that same first paragraph to "powerful competitor" may not sit well with the FTC with respect to the antitrust issues (probably not fatal, but we ought to think of another desciptive word). Second version: Technically, I would say "secured" by, as opposed to "supported" by the assets of the pipelines when referring to the credit support for the facilities. Second paragraph: Same comments as the first paragraph in the first version addressed above. Third paragraph: I don't think it is a good idea to talk about "strong verbal indications" regarding the extension of maturities unless you are just about 100% confident that they will, in fact, be extended. I think we are sending a message by such a statement that this maturity will be extended. If there is a chance that it will not, I think this is a risky statement to make. If it is made, perhaps we should include a forward looking statement factor to the effect "factors include Enron's ability to restructure scheduled maturities of debt" (but my first choice would be not to include the quote). I will try to be in early in the morning if you want to discuss. Thanks, Rex -----Original Message----- From: Kean, Steven J.

RE: Information (Confidential)	Jordan: (1) Yes to Section 13 (any and all filings required by the '34 Act)---10-Qs, 10-Ks, 8-Ks, 13Ds, Form 4s (pursuant to Section 16) etc. Any and all '34 Act filings by Enron Corp. are available at the SEC's website----that is the fastest and most efficient way to access them. (2) SEC file number: Enron Corp.-1-13159; (3) Total assets and liabilities: I would use our latest 10-Q filed last week; however, as we all know, these are not only unaudited, we do not have the AA SAS 71 letter (limited review letter required for quarterly financials). Perhaps we should consult Causey as to the answer to this question (although my best guess would be the third quarter financial statements just filed with the SEC; (4) Debt securities and number of holders---I would have no way of knowing this---I would check with corporate treasury (Tim DeSpain, Clint Freeland and the folks in their group). The group responsible for paying the interest on our debt securities would know the answer to this, and that would be corporate treasury. As to number of holders, they may have to contact the trustee of the debt securities (for most of the public debt securities, I believe that would be Bank of New York, as successor trustee to Harris Trust, Enron's long-time trustee; (5) Number of shares of Preferred Stock ---I thought this list was included in the schedules to the Merger Agreement, but I can't seem to put my hands on the schedules. I will try to get this list to you today or early in the morning (Sunday). Brenda Funk may also have an up-to-date list (the recent preferred stock issuances relate to structured financings, which are deals I don't work on---that's the reason I don't have this info at my fingertips---but I think I can get it for you, tomorrow morning, if not today); (6) As of October 31 (according to 10-Q filed last week: 743,904,638 shares of common stock issued and outstanding (this does not include treasury shares---if we need that number, we will have to get from the corporate secretary's office); (7) Desciption of Enron's business: I agree with you, we can lift this from the current 10-Q filed last week (anything before that may be out of date); (8) Look at the draft of the Proxy Statement that I sent to you yesterday (the reference to Janus is as of February of this year---as you know, institutional holders of 5% or more only have to file an annual Schedule 13G (on on before Feb. 14 of each year). Of course, other 5% or greater owners must file a 13D shortly after acquiring their holdings, and I am not aware that we have received a Schedule 13D lately (the issuer is supposed to receive a copy, as well as the SEC). Mark Koenig in Investor Relations might have a handle on who Enron's current owners are (without a Schedule 13D, we can assume that no one else owns in excess of 5%). (9) With respect to Enron Corp. common and second preferred convertible stock, there are literally thousands of holders. I assume the only way to get this information is the shareholder lists from the Transfer Agent (or, possibly the corporate secretary's office would have this info---if not, they would be the group that knows how to get it); (10) See No. 9 above. Jordan and Julia: The information that we would need to get from Enron's transfer agent or Enron's trustees for its debt securities would not be available from those entities until Monday; if we needed it before then, as noted above the best sources of information would be the Enron Treasury group (with respect to debt securities outstanding) and the corporate secretary's office (Paula Rieker and Elaine Overturf) with respect to shareholder lists. I apologize in advance that I will be necessarily out of pocket Saturday afternoon, but plan to be in the office all day Sunday if I can help with this.

In re F&J Representation	By telefax of November 21, Uriel Dutton of F&J provided a proposed waiver letter agreement for our review. I will have copies of that proposed agreement circulated by hand-delivery and fax to all those on this list and to Mariner's GC. At present, I am not sending this e-mail to Mariner's GC. If there is someone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know. Chuck and I have reviewed the letter, believe it to be overly broad, and hope that F&J is willing to negotiate further, along the following lines: 1. On page 1, third full paragraph, second line, we suggest inserting "Enron Corp. and " between "representation of" and "Enron's affiliates". 2. On page 4, paragraph (4), we are concerned about the third sentence, which reads as follows: "Enron Corp. agrees that it will cause each existing or future affiliate of Enron Corp. to comply with the agreements of the Enron Entities herein set forth." We think, although we do not know for sure, that F&J's concern is that F&J may become adverse in the future to some existing Enron entity that F&J does not currently represent, or that does not currently exist, and that either of these two entities may seek to assert disqualification based on F&J's current representation of Enron entities. If this is the reason for the sentence, we don't see how an existing Enron entity or future Enron entity could assert a conflict that has been waived by the Enron entity that is actually being represented. We also have a concern about asking Enron Corp. to cause all of its "affiliates", as defined in the letter agreement, to comply with it. Enron Corp. may not have the power to require all its "affiliates" to comply. Our suggestion would be that this letter agreement be signed on behalf of all the actual Enron entities currently represented by F&J, including Mariner. 3. On page 4, 17 lines from the top, we find objectionable the language that begins, "Without limiting the foregoing..." It seems to us that here, F&J wants all the Enron companies to be considered separately for disqualification purposes, and perhaps to be able to sue one Enron entity even though F&J is representing another Enron entity in a substantially related matter. 3. On pages 4-5, paragraph (5), we have a concern about the third sentence, which reads as follows: "If Dynegy declines or fails to do so promptly after receipt of our request, it is expressly agreed and understood that F&J shall be entitled..." Our concern is that we are committing Enron entities to an agreed course of action post-merger based on speculation as to what Dynegy may or may not do. Our suggestion would be that we simply ask F&J to delete all but the first two sentences of paragraph (5). 4. Please note that under the terms of this proposed agreement, we are not requiring F&J to be liable for the ramp-up costs of new counsel for, e.g., the Licensing Project or the asbestosis cases (in the event that Enron Corp. cannot be dismissed from the asbestosis cases pre-trial). We do not believe that ramp-up costs will be something F&J will agree to if we need F&J to take on the new Mariner matter. Mariner's GC called me today to advise that it was urgent that she know today or tomorrow whether F&J was going to be able to represent Mariner on a new, critical asset-sale matter that is scheduled to close no later than December 27; otherwise, she will need to hire other counsel to handle that matter. Please let us have your comments as soon as possible. Britt	1

I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement. In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult. regards Ed Sophie.

In re F&J Representation	Bob and I just spoke with Steve Susman. I tried to mention the points you asked. Here are his comments: 1. F&J probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with Arthur Anderson. Susman believes that there is a "hot potato" rule that prevents F&J from doing so. 2. That being said, Susman doesn't care if F&J represents Arthur Anderson or anyone else potentially adverse to us in the actions he is handling. 3. Susman would not, however, agree to a broad advance ethical waiver, as proposed by F&J. He does not believe such waivers are effective. Susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who F&J wanted to represent. I don't know whether F&J would agree to this or not. 4. Susman recognizes that we cannot force F&J to take on the new Mariner matter, and that this is ultimately a risk/benefit decision for us to make, and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldn't agree to. Parenthetically, I have received no comments on F&J's proposed waiver letter. Under the circumstances, from his standpoint, Bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with F&J, but that if F&J won't budge, that we take something along the lines of what they have given us (Bob, let me know if I have mischaracterized your thoughts). From my standpoint, I unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed. This would be to the extent that the letter purports to have Enron Corp. agree to bind all the Enron entities, and to the extent that it involves Enron's agreement to what will happen after the Dynegy merger (as I set out in my earlier e-mail). My recommendation would be, as set forth in my earlier e-mail, that only the Enron entities currently being represented by F&J sign it and be bound by it, and to remove the language regarding what Enron would agree to after the Dynegy merger. I also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant, but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made. I do not know whether F&J would be willing to make these changes or not. Our biggest problem right now is time-management. I know that Mariner wanted to make a decision by today as to who to use. I am willing to confer with Dutton ASAP to see what F&J would agree to, and if he can agree in principle, to send him a proposed draft agreement. I believe he is out of the office but is checking his voice-mail. Please let me know what you want me to do. Britt	1

I said nothing new, but did clarify a quote that had appeared from PGE in the previous story Manning wrote. I've copied Doug on this because the issue is getting more serious. Manning informed me that The Oregonian has now assigned him and Gail Hill to "charge ahead and do more on this story." They want to sit down with HR and review documentation that proves that we have provided financial planning counsel, that we have provided information about diversifying portfolios, etc. This is strongly leaning in the legal area, and we would like to have counsel before saying anything further. We can't expect much cover from Enron, either: Manning vented to me about how no one there will return his calls. Carol, Gail, Kregg and I can be available to meet early tomorrow to discuss how to move ahead on this. Doug, let us know if sometime before noon might work for you. Thanks.	2

FW: TW Daily Balance Report	The attached file has July 2001 and September 2001 analyzed. I have compared the TW Balance Report to Actuals for July 2001 (see attached spreadsheet) and feel that the Fuel Retention numbers are good. The Fuel Burned numbers are generally too low due to missing 3-days of actuals and some fuel meters are inputted only once a month and will be missing from the balance report. However, when you use Ken's report just estimate the fuel numbers 25% higher and you will be OK. The remaining volumes (Retention less Fuel less Sales) will equal imbalances and UAF. Ken's report (area under construction) needs work to solve the imbalance question and we can discuss this next week. He will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday. Also, I want to make one thing clear. Sales go to the bottom line, however if your selling imbalance gas received from a customer or line pack you will have an expense offset that also goes to the bottom line. Conversely, if you are repaying (giving) gas to a customer you will have an expense credit that goes to the bottom line. Over-retained gas (Retention less Fuel less UAF) is the only bottom line amount. You can sell the gas outright or sell it to the customers imbalance or linepack. If you sell it to linepack or volume valued imbalances, you will have taken on commodity risk. We can discuss TW's risk profile next week.

RE: ECS Contract Review & New Idea	Dave, If possible, I would like for you to sit down with Lindy and a few folks from our group who have been looking at this. I want to make sure that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be duplicating anything. I will have Lindy contact you so we can set something up and then move forward as necessary. Thanks. Steve -----Original Message----- From: david.a.foti@accenture.com@ENRON Sent: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 7:20 AM To: Harris, Steven Subject: ECS Contract Review & New Idea Steve - I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350). I would like to send you an engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k). I think we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some flexibility if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for the hours we use. I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each. To the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close whatever option you choose. In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note that I would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis (e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks full-time). Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that we can have the deliverable complete by mid December. Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with these terms. ======================== As for the new idea ---- I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset position/market intelligence. It occurred to me that there is an analogy here that relates to pipelines. Pipelines have operational "events" that may have market effects: Unplanned outage (major/minor/duration/notice) Planned outages over a certain volume Operation flow order/ SOLs Key Plants backed in Takes over schedule volumes key points Linepack levels Pressure drops at key points Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through gas needed for operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would be studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market risk (read generate income). TW can setup a risk management group to execute this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to have a risk management function - Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of Risk Management for Pipelines. These "events" would be studied in the follow way - 1. Determine whether there is a correlation between an "event" and gas prices/basis differentials. - based on historical data. 2. For those events that have a strong correlations, develop a trading strategy around the relationship. 3. Back-test the trading strategy against historical data - determine profitability. 4. For operational "events" that are applicable, setup a system to execute program trading that is directly linked to SCADA. Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would be developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of selling the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some combination of both) Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can start drawing up a workplan for this study. Dave David A.

Steve -----Original Message----- From: david.a.foti@accenture.com@ENRON Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 3:52 PM To: Harris, Steven Subject: TW Earnings Idea - Twist on ECS Deals Hello Steve - Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well. A quick update - I moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago and have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline Optimization projects. I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting. Accenture has a strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology for making maintenance decisions. They are the standard for electric T&D companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment. This is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal: 1. TW hires Accenture to implement RCM 2. RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks) 3. Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from RCM (say $20MM) as part of our "guarantee" 4. TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over the next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case. I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am around the Enron building. Let me know if you would like to get together to discuss further. Hope all is well.

RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding	I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about "Shipper Imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this: In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order ("OFO") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas. Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties. If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you. Terry Kowalke	1

Jan NSS clean up	Here is what we think the problems related to Jan close are: Problem #1: when we killed all forward PGL deals in TAGG for the inventory transfer, we killed Jan activity even though most of this gas flowed. Solution #1: We added Jan activity back into the book and removed only the portion of gas that did not flow. Total Jan activity was $7.2 million for NSS 2 and we added $5 million back into the book for the gas that actually flowed. Problem #2: We add erroneously added back Nov and Dec liquidations into Jan for NSS1. These liquidations basically represent the inventory balance for NSS 1. Solution #2: We have killed the annuity to add back the liquidations. This will create a $13 million loss for Jan. The offsetting value was booked when we booked the inventory sell to PGL on 1/18/02. We hope the above transactions will correct Jan P&L and the month-to-date P&L will represent a more reasonable amount. This should close out all of the EMW activity. Call me if anyone has any questions. Richard 312.541.1231 -----Original Message----- From: Kennedy, Phyllis R.

RE: GD Options	thanks. I'll look at the PGL deals in a few minutes We think we may have found part of the problem. We believe that the problem may be in the way we booked annuities to zero Nov & Dec activity for NSS year 3. I would like to bounce it off you when we pull all the info together. Once we correct the problem, we need to change Jan for EMW and enovate. Phyllis said it was not too late. Do you know of any reason that we couldn't restate Jan today? I'll call you later. Richard	1
FW: EMW liquidation	Here is my recommendation for the liquidation of EMW. I would like to transact as early as Monday, so let me know if we need to clear any other hurdles before transacting. 1. Terminate all physical and financial deals between ENA and EMW. (approximate $24.5 million loss to EMW and gain to ENA). The loss will be removed from EMW's commodity book and recorded in Schedule E. This creates a payable on ENA and a receivable on EMW. Jeff - can you help create a document that terminates all transactions with ENA starting in Feb 02? 2. Sell all NSS inventory to PGL at current market price (expected proceeds $24 million in Cash). I think both parties are agreeable to using the relevant published Gas Daily price on the trade date. EMW will generate transaction confirmation under the master purchase agreement 4. Cash proceeds will be used to pay down I\C payable with ENA. Cash will be expected on trade date. 5. EMW will continue to show its receivable from ENA from the termination of the hedges and the I\C payable to ENA on its balance sheet. Accounting is researching if netting these amounts is appropriate. EMW will carefully monitor these balances. It is important that the I\C balance not be reduced to an amount less than its receivable to ENA. Additional income \ cash generated in EMW will be moved to enovate to prevent future I\C pay down. We hope to have the accounting for Dec activity finished soon. EMW's books will be left with some demand charge related to the Trunkline deal and may have some other "sleaving" transactions such as the ROG transaction. I will work with Phyllis and Mark to finalize the NSS program Year 2 and calculate a demand credit, if any, to PGL. I expect EMW to remain dormant, except for the above, until a final decision is made on it status. Richard	2

Option Grid Changes to show months with 0 value	John, I went through the code and realized that the change to show months with 0 value is a little big change and cannot be done in hours. The problem I see is that when portcalc values a post id, it does not create any data in database for the months where you do not have positions. What it means it can be done but it will take minimum 3-4 days to make the changes, test it and give it to you. Also it will slow down option grid a little more as I need to build rows with 0 values which are not in database. I just wanted to give you an update and I will talk to Karima & Francis to let them know how we are going to handle it. Let me know if you have any questions.	1
RE: Texaco	Mike: It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways. Those alternatives are as follows: 1. We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount. 2. If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the amount we are paying them. Of course, we would need to provide them some sort of explanation. My preference at this time would be to do the first item. If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter. If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item. I trust all is well with you. I look forward to hearing from you.

Also, Bob, about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), following the recent seminar we did for them in HK, I think that we are likely to hear more from them about membership.

RE: 2002 IT Budgets	Joe - Thanks for the information. As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke. As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the "sponsor" of any of them. Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects. Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action. I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call. Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I "approve" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a "placeholder" for the budget. I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these "approvals" if the budget has been approved. If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so. Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the "extranet" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn. Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward. I will advise you accordingly.

Schuler Can you informally approve these 3 projects? Is this formal commitment to the projects? No. This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval. You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year. So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.	2

RE: Potts Opinion	Not unexpectedly this seems to me consistent with our thinking so far.. I am with Diane - I think ISDA can serve a valuable function by coming out with a statement saying that a) we have canvassed many dealers in the market and the prevailing opinion is that the particular Railtrack Convertible is deliverable b) we do not see it as ISDA's place to make binding interpretations on the market, but our own interpretation is consistent with this view and c) attach the Potts QC Opinion (if we are permitted to do so) But we shouldn't play this up as another "issue" for the Credit Derivative market beyond what it is. And as more of these types of matters arise we should consider what criteria dictate our involvement K -----Original Message----- From: Kimberly Summe [mailto:KSumme@isda.org] Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 4:30 PM To: ISDA BOARD Cc: Robert Pickel Subject: Potts Opinion Attached is the draft Robin Potts opinion on Railtrack. This opinion is not for distribution at this point. Could you please let me know if you have any questions or issues by Wednesday morning? Thanks, Kimberly	2
Master Netting Agreement: Update, Issues, Questions	We are nearing the "final" form of the document for further use. I have asked Bradford to speak with you regarding use of it for major trading counterparties that may not be investment grade, but with whom Credit sees the ability to greatly enhance our liquidity via netting of margin requirements (not the small accounts). Two issues. 1. Do you think we should write a risk memo concerning the issues surrounding the ultimate effectiveness under the Code and "square setoff" rights? Basically, the intent would be to clarify that if a court did not enforce the close-out netting, and then did not enforce the square setoff, our collateral position on a trading master by trading master basis could be underwater because we would have netted the positions under the master netting agreement for margining purposes. Further to this, the bankruptcy reform aspects of this issue are not moving as previously hoped due to consumer issues and current events. 2. FYI: It has come to my attention this week that Global Finance has consummated a receivable financing, and desires to consummate additional such financings which conflict with master netting agreements in place (as well as setoff language in trading contracts) and with the general concept of master netting for the future. We are meeting tomorrow with Bradford and Global Finance representatives to gather facts, sort through the issues, and try to resolve what appear to be different objectives concerning trading receivables. From a cash perspective, I would think Enron as whole would get more benefit from master netting (dollar for dollar benefit) than loan security (which would never be a dollar for dollar benefit)--do you think this is a correct analysis?	2
Legal Risk Memo	Mark Just a quick question while I remember, as you know I am giving an overview of the DASH process and the Legal Risk Memo that must accompany any DASH. My understanding is that the Legal Risk Memo must be attached to the DASH when the DASH is circulated and that on the face of the DASH form prepared by RAC, we should not be and there should not appear any Legal Risk assessment, which must only be contained in the Legal Risk Memo. The DASH should simply refer to "See attached Legal Risk Memo". I am hoping that this is also how you like to see the process work in practice. In addition I am going to say that if possible you need to be briefed and receive a draft of the Legal Risk Memo before it is circulated with the DASH. See you shortly. Marcus	2
E-mail retention	As I mentioned to you last week, there are currently about 50 EBS employees who are exempt from the Enron e-mail retention policy. These individuals were exempted from the e-mail retention policy in order to preserve documents related to the Blockbuster litigation. Now that the Blockbuster litigation is over, there is no reason for these individuals to continue to be exempt from the e-mail retention policy. I propose sending the following e-mail to the currently exempt EBS employees: _____________ For the past several months, because of the necessity to preserve documents relating to the Blockbuster litigation, you have been exempted from Enron's e-mail retention policy. The Blockbuster litigation has now concluded. Therefore, beginning Monday, October 15, 2001, you will be subject to the e-mail retention policy. As a reminder, that policy provides as follows: Message Location - Maximum Retention Inbox - 30 days Sent Mail Folder - 30 days Trash/Deleted Items - Rollover from Inbox for one day Folders - All Email messages placed in folders will be destroyed after one calendar year. This includes public folders in Outlook. Furthermore, it is against policy to store Email outside of your Outlook Mailbox and/or your Public Folders. Please do not copy Email onto floppy disks, zip disks, CDs or the network. Such actions are prohibited and will not be supported by the IT Department. There will be no exceptions to this policy.	1
In re F&J Representation	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence: 1. Theresa Bushman. Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history. Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond. 2. Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC. Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval. Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this. 3. Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law. John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations. In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future. John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances. 4. Uriel Dutton. Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following: a. F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the "Method and System for the Determination of VAR"). b. F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial. c. Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration. We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week. Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone. Proposed going forward strategy: Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J. We invite comments. Britt	1
In re F&J Representation	This follows up on my voice-mail to you of just a few minutes ago. I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J. She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions. Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date. Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said. I see two options: 1. If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is: I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today. If I can't, Mariner retains someone else today. Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started. 2. If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is. Caveat: I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly. Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys. I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running. If there is anyone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know. I am in all day today; please let me know what you want me to do. Britt	1

Alberta PPA	Lisa, I'm the commercial person responsible for the sale of the Alberta PPA. I was looking for an update on where this issue is at. It is my understanding that we need to have the bankruptcy court bless ENA's shareholders resolution for the sale of the PPA. Have we applied to the court to hear this matter? What does the prospective timing look like? I'm assuming that you are the individual responsible for coordinating this effort. We are in a situation here where collateral demands ($23.7MM) have been made on Enron Canada Power Corp. which are due on Tuesday, December 18. ECPC does not have the capacity to post this collateral. It is my fear that the counterparty demanding the collateral will petition ECPC into court protection upon non-compliance with the collateral demand. Additionally, it is unclear how any court proceeding with Enron Canada Corp. may affect both ECPC and the PPA. It is my understanding that there may be some activity on this front early next week. Either one of these issues may cause a default under the PPA. At that point in time the Owner of the PPA is free to terminate. If the PPA is terminated, the value of this asset would go to zero. It is clear that the Owner of the PPA is itching to terminate and this would terminate the proposed sale to Altagas Services of $215 MM. Could you please get back to me with some guidance on this issue.	2
Restructuring (Confidential Communications)	At the right time, it would be helpful to discuss what we may want to consider as "Core" Assets (unrelated to trading activities) for purposes of emerging from bankruptcy as a going concern. As you know, we are in the process of organizing and formatting in an asset matrix the assets/businesses we currently own (or otherwise have an interest in) that may be potentially for sale; separating out potential core assets will be instructive as part of this process. Please let me know your thoughts/suggestions over the next few weeks.	2

FW: Richardson Products Co.	I've made a few changes as marked. We should talk about whether or not we will accept immediate payment for the Nov. bill sufficient to bring them back to credit worthiness for their ongoing business or require them to provide additional security or Letter of Credit. Comments? Kim	1
RE: Richardson Products Co.	I would agree, as long as the payment was before Jan 1, so that they would be current before the next month flows began. To the extent that they are not current then they do not meet the creditworthiness standards. So as a solution to the whole thing, they pay on monday and we will forget the bad credit issue. They pay after that and they are reported as a late payor/non-creditworthy. It's at least a choice for them to make.	1
MISO Losses - MORE News	After talking further with MISO folks about the new attachment M, it appears that the MISO will _effectively_ be requiring physical losses, although they don't come out and say that. Financial losses are essentially at the option of the TO, so we "may" be able to do Financial losses if the TOs want to offer the service. In more detail, this is how the process will work: TCs will use the MISO's loss calculator to identify impacted TOs If ALL TOs have provided financial loss pricing information, then it will be possible to buy losses If not, the TC will be required to self supply TOs can change their loss pricing (or desire to offer financial losses) every 12 hours. Effectively, this means it will be difficult at best to manage risk associated with having the FIN rug pulled out from under us at scheduling time. I will continue to work on this issue with Mike and push for a financial solution that provides for our needs.	2
Re: PEER GROUP MAPPING	Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure, that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public Affairs groups who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end. On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated, is that it may be entirely counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour. Thanks.	2
Cooler Houston Project/ Follow-Up to Denver Discussion	Dear Ken: It was great to see you in Denver. The group of leaders from the Western Governors' Association and major businesses were energized to take control of their destiny, and your ideas contributed enormously. I think that you and I are very much on the same page regarding the President's Energy Report and the opportunities that it presents. In addition, Joe Romm and I have worked a bit with the Enron Energy Services team on some initial ways to highlight and quantify the "green" aspects of the EES product. You are well positioned to prove what initiatives bring both business and energy/environmental benefits. Per our discussion, I have attached below a copy of a confidential preliminary report on the potential for a "Cooler Houston" initiative. The scientific models relating to "urban heat island effects" indicate that planting trees, lightening the color of roofs and resurfacing pavement with lighter material can reduce ambient high temperatures in Houston and thus potentially lead to ozone reductions far cheaper than the cost of the "last mile" tons indicated in current SIP efforts. Success requires developing some technical agreement and common cause among U.S. EPA, TNRCC, the City of Houston, and business and civic leaders in the City. Bill White and the leadership of the Greater Houston Partnership have been spearheading early work on this. Our team is working with U.S. EPA and TNRCC to see if they can agree on the models. We would be very interested in your ideas on this. Moreover, if the technical people can agree in concept, we would value your support of an achievable Cooler Houston plan going forward. Naturally, the plan is exciting because it offers economic, air quality and broader quality-of-life benefits to the Houston community. Ever since we developed the acid rain trading program, I have enjoyed promoting such ideas! Please let me know anything else that you need. I hope to see you soon. In the meantime, best wishes to you and the family. Sincerely, Hank Habicht	2
October London meeting	Herewith a few ideas for the October meeting in London, some of them after checking with Paul Portney and with Pankaj. I offer these very, very preliminary thoughts just to start you thinking - do you want your UK colleagues on the program; do we want some ancillary events? After getting your views on questions such as these, I can make more definite suggestions. I certainly think that we should convene a few hours before the opening dinner so that the advisors can have a tour of the building and the facilities. Also, I am hoping that Steve will leave some time on this trip for a tour of the new BA headquarters - very innovative. We should consider doing something on the global warming question from the viewpoint of the Europeans. Start with three recommendations on the political side that Paul received from David Victor of the Council on Foreign Relations (characterized as "a VERY smart guy on climate"): Tony Brenton (Deputy chief of mission, UK embassy in DC. Has been on UK climate delegations for a decade; smart and lively; pragmatic; insightful). Bo Kjellen (Swedish head of delegation; knows European politics inside out; big figure in Europe). Tubiana, Laurence (Conseil d'Analyse Economique, France; knows the issue and can speak to French position, but may not have the gravitas of Kjellen or Brenton). Among other ideas (I have winnowed out several) is a guy named Liam Salter at Climate Network Europe. Brussels based, but relatively junior. Paul also recommends a woman by the name of Laurence Tubiana, an economist in the French government's equivalent of the CEA; she has a reputation as a good presenter and a good economist. WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THESE FOLKS OUT WITH YOUR LONDON PEOPLE, AND GET ADDITIONAL NAMES FROM THEM. THE GOAL IS TO GIVE ALL OF US A PERSPECTIVE ON THE EUROPEAN VIEW ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - UNLESS YOU THINK THAT NOT A USEFUL TOPIC. I turn now to Pankaj's suggestion, which I transmit verbatim: "I remember promising to scout around and see if there were a European whom it would be interesting to invite to talk to the Enron International Advisory Council about the (non) convergence of governance structures in Europe, particularly on the Continent, to the U.S. model. I got the following names from Jay Lorsch (apparently all members of the committee steering a multifaculty Harvard business School project on governance in comparative perspective) as possibilities. Jay suggested that Sihler would be best (former CEO of Henkel, very senior), Peter's second best (apparently, chairman of Amsterdam Stock Exchange now) and Smith - formerly Managing partner at Price Waterhouse Coopers - would be the most junior of the three. I don't personally know any of the three." Now some ideas of my own, again acting on the assumption that we want a two-way educational dialogue - to give your folks in London and Europe a run-down on the situation in the US, and the US contingent a better understanding of how European policymakers view the issues we all face. 1.Bill Kristol on the US political scene, in which there is great interest here, and great misunderstanding of the Bush administration. We might also consider inviting Larry Lindsey or some other Bush person if allowed to do so. 2. Someone on the European view on global warming (see suggestions above). 3. Energy regulation in the UK. Callum McCarthy. 4. Economic outlook. Gavyn Davies (usual talk). 5. What went wrong in California (great interest in that over here) and how to fix it. Steve could do this, or you could invite Bill Hogan (just joking) or the chairman of FERC if we are allowed to pay his way. 6. Motivating people in a multinational, multicultural organization. If this is of interest, I can get recommendations for speakers. 7. I would be inclined to add a high-level speaker on the state of US-UK-European relations, perhaps as a dinner speaker. Between Gavyn and me, we might be able to get Chancellor Gordon Brown, a very interesting guy, and the inventor of the "climate change levy" that is driving industry in this country nuts. Please look this over. Steve and I have to get together, preferably with Ken, which leads me to suggest Aspen during the Institute's energy forum, which I understand Ken will be attending. But if that is not feasible, Steve and I can work out a date for a preliminary meeting, followed up by one with Ken at his convenience. END	2
Management & Leadership	Ken, Greg, Mark - Thank you for your leadership over the last several weeks and this morning. We appreciate it. Following are some additional thoughts and some more detail on my comments from this morning: The leadership group in that room needs to feel the sense of responsibility to lead our businesses. Everything we say & do - including all written, verbal and "body language" - are signals. We must communicate and lead all day, every day. As an organization, and as part of our culture, we lead with our chin - always have and probably always will. We are going to take our share of bumps and bruises. We have some great businesses here....and we are fortunate. We have grown the size and profitability of our core businesses substantially, and in a market where many companies have not been as successful. Most of our wounds are self - inflicted. We can and should do a better job. I believe this leadership team needs to make an absolute commitment in the following areas: Vision - define what we want this company to be in the next 3-5 years Value - as part of building the World's Leading Company, my vote is that we dedicate our energy towards building long term, sustainable value. This is not about just creating value in the eyes of Wall Street - this is about creating real value, perhaps as defined by "after tax operating profit minus the real cost of capital". Market cap will follow this type of economic value creation. We need to measure it and incent people this way. Teamwork - we are a leadership team. I don't feel as though everyone buys into that nor is it clear that everyone around that table feels a sense of responsibility to lead across the business. I would like to discuss how we improve as a team. Many of our employees (at an average age of 33 years) have never been through: an economic downturn a global military conflict problems like the ones we are currently experiencing at Enron We need big time leadership now....from all who are around that table Clear Demonstration of our leadership - in clear view of our employees, customers and shareholders People - we must make sure to retain and enhance the interest of the employees that add value to Enron everyday. These people need to believe - with our actions - that we are absolutely focused on making sure they have an environment that is conducive to building and creating value over the short, medium and long term. The ball is in our court. We have to lead and be perceived as credible leaders. We've got to dig deep and get down the road - together. If you wish, I would be pleased to discuss this further. Thank you again for your leadership.	2
Enron meeting	Gavyn Davies, via Helen Turley, has asked me to give you some guidance as to what you might include in your presentations at the meeting on October 31st. I do so with trepidation, since I am sure that you know more about your subject than I do, so please regard the following merely as suggestions to be ignored if you deem it appropriate to do so. We have blocked out two hours (9-11AM) to discuss market opportunities for Enron in Spain and Germany. My understanding is that Oscar will go first, as he has a plane to catch. I would suggest that each of you plan on speaking for about 30 (no more than 40) minutes, so as to leave time for questions from what will be a lively audience of Enron executives. You might want to begin with a general description of the political situation, followed by a description of the present and future state of the economy in each country. Then, you might turn to a more specific discussion of matters of interest to Enron: the state of regulation and deregulation of energy markets, the areas you consider should be of interest to Enron as business opportunities, etc. I do hope this is of help	2
Enron Isda	The following points. All final revisions accepted other than as noted below. Please provide us by separate cover the generic risk disclosure as we do not intend to use it as an exhibit. Rounding: I added liters at 5 decimal places (to coordinate with gallons). Cross Default Threshold is at 150,000,000 for all Enron parties. Part 7 revisions not completely accepted. Please review and call, I will explain. Note the ETA currently is between ENA on its behalf and on behalf of all affiliates. It does not make sense to assign it. We are verifying our consent to your change in the Interest Rate definition. Please review collateral threshold to be sure it is as our credit departments agreed. I believe it is. Gaffney will attach form of guaranty in the execution process. As and when finally approved, our paralegal, Stephanie Panus, will commence final version paperwork and send to Gaffney for our execution and guaranty supplement, and he will forward to you.	2
RE: XL Trading Partners Ltd	Adele, I reviewed the opinion and there were several changes to the form from the prior draft. I would like to discuss two of the additions with your counsel if that would be ok with you. The first addition at issue is subpart k at the end of the first paragraph on page two. It looks like we may need a representation from you that you are not and will not carry on investment business in or from within Bermuda and that you will not perform your obligations under the Agreement in or from within Bermuda in order for the opinion to have value. The second addition at issue is subpart (e) under section 8 of the opinion. As written it looks like a large loop hole that can be taken advantage of just by finding evidence that was not submitted at the trial. Our General Counsel is concerned with what looks like an easy way to circumvent a foreign judgment. I would appreciate your thoughts or any clarification I can get. Regards, Brent Hendry	2
RE: Confidentiality Agreement	Derek, I spoke to Stephanie yesterday and she updated the Confidentiality Agreement following our discussion. The following references status of the points discussed: 1. The updated agreement includes a definition of "affiliate". This is acceptable to me. 2. Two year term. This is okay. 3. Request for Californiajurisdiction. Stephanie said they could not agree to a Californiajurisdiction. Her argument calling for a New Yorkjurisdiction is that the purpose of the Confidentiality Agreement is to facilitate a credit review, and Enron is familiar with dealing with credit matters under New Yorklaw. 4. Arbitration. I told her we would agree to no changes on Arbitration wording from Enron format. I told Stephanie that I would discuss with you before I get back to her. Thanks. Tim	1

RE: Transwestern Red Rock Expansion	Bill, Thanks for including me. I have no further comments or suggestions.

Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks. << File: TWFERCExtension.doc >>	2
RE: answer to cpuc protest	I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m. Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.

RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding	I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about "Shipper Imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this: In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order ("OFO") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas. Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties. If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.	1
TW ROFR	Upon receipt of a notice to exercise ROFR, you must determine the criteria of when the notice is required, In the example provided I'm told it required a one year notice therefore if the contract terminated 10/31/02, notice was due 10/31/01. Therefore 10 days after 10/31/01 the capacity must be posted for bidding. In the interim, since it has not yet been posted a transaction could be negotiated and the shipper would then be required to provide notice of resinding the original election to participate in the Rofr process. If this isn't clear, please call MK	2
Switzer v. Chevron, et al	Kathy, You helped me on this before. Plaintiffs are now pressing for a deposition on December 5 of a Rule 30(b)(6) corporate representative of TW in this matter in Houston at Susman, Godfrey's office. You have already sent to me a list of contracts that might be relevant. Bill Rapp got a telefax just recently on this from a Wes Hahn, who is apparently acting as a consultant/expert in this case for defendants. Hahn has suggested that he appear as TW's corporate rep in this matter. Hahn advises that he was an officer of TW and Enron "at the time that this contract was in force and when it was terminated." I guess he means the processing contract between plaintiffs and Chevron that was terminated around 1996 when Chevron sold the Leedey plant to Dynegy. Let's talk tomorrow about how many contracts we have, how long they might take to review for privileges, etc., who would be the right corporate representative for TW, and so forth. If you can think of anyone else who should be involved, please let me know. Given that Becky Zikes has actually worked for TW some years ago as a contract administrator, I'm going to ask her to attend our conference, as well as Barbara O'Banion, who just recently joined the Unit as a contract legal assistant. I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow. Britt P.S.: Dari, I included you because a processing plant was involved and thought you might be interested. Do you want to be kept in the loop?	2

RE: Faith-based contracting	>What do you think is the next best step? The next step is to gather up a few players who share this view and go to Mike as a non-Enron proposal and try it that way. I am going to give the idea a test drive with perhaps the most provocative and difficult and potentially significant player in the drama, Brenda Anderson of BPA. The Queen of Bonneville Trading sits over there across the river and survives on sheer guts and effrontery. I am going to saddle my horse, attach a white kerchief to my saber and ride over behind the lines for a secret caucus. This is the stuff of real diplomacy that could be fruitful. Meanwhile, to hell with San Diego. Something will happen and it won't matter so we should focus on the big picture and let the ants gather there and scramble among the crumbs. ----cgy	1
Faith-based contracting	I agree with Christian that we cannot win over the WSPP folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours. Everytime I venture out to the larger NW community of IOUs, munis, and federal PMA's I realize that the WSPP is more than a contract, it's almost a religion. One cannot convince a Muslim that the Bible is better written than the Koran. Whether it's assimilation or merger, or the hint that the WSPP might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education, we need to give Mike Small a face-saving way of relinquishing the WSPP contract. Modifying the WSPP to look like the EEI only strengthens the resolve of WSPP-ers to stick with the original contract.---"Why should I change, the agreements are virtually identical?"	1
Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info	As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd. This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002. I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below. Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26. In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible. Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product. Main argument: Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows "marketer firm" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources. Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation "owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load," and 2) a Network Customer "must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract" in order to designate a Network Resource. Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource: - permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems - Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation - allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity - since retail providers are allowed to rely on "over-the-counter" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources. It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.	1
Sierra Pacific Power/Nevada Power	Elizabeth, Background: On Wednesday, October 10, the NPUC voted to authorize its General Counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain SPP/NP long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at FERC. According to the utilities, the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $800 million. Enclosed, you'll find. . . .: Attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical Enron-SPP/NP deals that are (1) currently flowing or (2) scheduled for future delivery. I have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of SPP/NP's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief, not refunds. I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP. Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals. However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission). It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0. Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million. Bottom line: All in all, I think the risk of FERC undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons: 1. The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about "ripple" claims. Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support. 2. SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive. This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds. 3. SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX. Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time. 4. If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts. Contracts/Collateral: These transactions are all under the WSPP. We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP. Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase. I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's "financial viability" decreases. My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call. I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as "punishing" SPP/NP for "trying to enforce the law," or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds. Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this. Mitigation: I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th. There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend. "Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?" There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC. Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.	2
RE: Middle Market Group	I agree we may need to circle the wagons, but I cannot see why the five (5) Origination lawyers in Portland cannot handle this change. They took our secretary, what more do they want? It's late, but here are a few initial thoughts: 1. If they can't get the work done with five lawyers, adding a Christian Yoder or Steve Hall to the mix won't save the day. (Okay, maybe it would, but I won't tell them that.) 2. Our traders need both of us to get the work done and to continue our great run of profitability. Why change something that is working so well? 3. I joined Enron to work with Christian and to report to Elizabeth. My position on work allocation is as follows: If the proposed project was something I would have done for Paul, Stewart, or John before they joined Orig, e.g., WAPA/BPA deal; EEI Master Contract; or a structured commodity deal, I would be happy to help in any way that I can add value. But if the project is an asset-driven transaction---e.g., something like Longview or LV Cogen, then I think that the Orig lawyers need to take that work.	1
RE: 2002 IT Budgets	Joe - Thanks for the information. As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke. As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the "sponsor" of any of them. Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects. Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action. I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call. Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I "approve" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a "placeholder" for the budget. I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these "approvals" if the budget has been approved. If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so. Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the "extranet" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn. Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward. I will advise you accordingly.	2

RE: Amendment to Master Credit Agreement	marc, we are in receipt of your email and appreciate the work you have put in on this. as i am sure that you understand and as has been discussed, we would need to evaluate all the proposed terms and conditions of this proposed transaction all together before seeking to obtain the requisite internal approvals here. it is my understanding that the proposed revision in the advance factor for utility billed receivables from 30 to 50% is not acceptable to the business people that would make a recommendation in the context of those internal approvals. it is my understanding that there are some other discussions over the last few days with respect to some ideas of newpower as to how to address further commodity price declines as well. i think that it would be fruitful at this point to not try to turn these documents unless and until there is a business meeting of the minds. we will read them however and be ready with comments. i think that we could quickly finish them off if an agreement is reached and the requisite internal approvals obtained. let me know if you think otherwise and we can discuss... i know robert is out today but elizabeth and i are in all day and available. -----Original Message----- From: Gail.Dapolite@NewPower.com@ENRON On Behalf Of Marc.Manly@NewPower.com Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 6:07 PM To: Eickenroht, Robert; Mellencamp, Lisa Cc: david.burns@bakerbotts.com; Tribolet, Michael; Bradford, William S.; Nettelton, Marcus; elizabeth.guffy@bakerbotts.com; joseph.cialone@bakerbotts.com; wesley.shields@bakerbotts.com Subject: Amendment to Master Credit Agreement Lisa and Robert: I attach a revised (new draft from NewPower) version of the Amendment and General Security Agreement, together with a blacklined version of this redraft against the last document we received from you. Our changes, which we have not had the opportunity to discuss directly with you, include the following: a revision of the security interest from a general lien to a lien on all receivables and inventory only, and an increase in the October cap from $20 to $25 million (which I understand were agreed between Cronin and Tribolet); a revision in the definition of Eligible Accounts to reflect receivables purchase arrangements with certain utilities (which I understand was agreed between Hermanson and Tribolet); a proposed revision in the advance factor for utility billed receivables from 30% to 50% (which has not been agreed but is our proposed fix to give us comfort that the Eligible Accounts get us up to the $25 million and $40 million limits) and certain other changes to correct typos or to clarify certain points as to which I believe we are in agreement. Notably, this draft contains no provisions that would protect NewPower against the risk of losing surety collateral, or the risk of commodity price declines that would require the posting of additional collateral. As to the latter risk, my clients and yours have been exploring swaps and other arrangements that we may employ to mitigate that risk. I also attach copies of proposed resolutions for the Business Review Committee and the Board of Directors in connection with these documents. On the assumption that these documents are acceptable, we have scheduled a meeting of the Business Review Committee for this upcoming Tuesday afternoon (we could not get a quorum any time today or Monday) and assuming a positive recommendation by the BRC, immediately thereafter we would schedule a telephone Board Meeting for all necessary approvals, at which point the documents could be executed and an 8-K disclosure filed.	2

Re: Collateral Annex	Hi Carol - It was good to hear from you. I have heard that they are keeping you pretty busy over there with Broadband and Power! With regard to Reliant's comments: Mid-Calculation language: Our comment/thought on this was made because we did not recall that this concept was ever approved by the Working Group. Current Mark-to-Market Value: I withdraw my comment. I have thought about it further and it is not relevant here. LC Evergreen language: I guess I would say that most of the time, the form LC we send to counterparties has this language in since it makes sense if the parties are going to have an ongoing trading relationship. I think that the Enron form has evergreen language too. It is more of an administrative hassle if it is not there but I don't have a strong feeling either way since we can just keep using our own form. I don't recall the discussion on this point and thus don't know if it was one person objecting or several. I hope this answers the questions. Thanks for doing all this work.

RE: underscheduling claim--pg&e	The most recent information from the CAISO shows our credit at $32,033,420.19. This amount if for the period of January 1, 2001 through April 6, 2001. The CAISO settlement folks will not break out PG&E's share of this amount because of incomplete data (the PX has necessary information from Jan-Feb 2001), (2) the numbers keep changing as the CAISO continues to run refunds, and (3) they claim that CAISO "legal" won't let them release information on PG&E's share. This morning I put in a call to a CAISO attorney, Beth Ann Burns, to lodge a formal request for data pursuant to CAISO Tariff section 11.20.2 showing PG&E's share of our underscheduling penalty revenues. She is looking into this. I have also asked Kit Blair in settlements to request an updated number showing revenues, if any, from April 6 through July. I will keep you advised of any developments.	2
new power	1. the defn of eligible accounts: UNBILLED-20%, NEW POWER BILLED-80%, UTILITY BILLED-30% also, the 61 days goes from invoice date. 2. the collateral defn which includes general intangibles and proceeds will stay same. 3. re acquisitions-no change to the way they can approve now re acquisition process, so 70% comes out. (robert-i did talk to bill and michael about and they are ok with as is b and b). 4. amend 7(c) of master agreement to say that they have to provide covenant compliance cert. which says whether or not they have a MAC--right now ways that they have to say they have no MAC. this amendment should survive the replacement collateral period and be for all time. that way they have to tell us only one way or the other and the MAC does not cause an independent default in 2(a) of the master. this is how we think should have worked to begin with consistent with our other masters. 5. keep negative pledge. 6. severance cap: say that no executive deferred compensation or "parachutes" or similar will be paid during the period with our released cash or any other cash unless we are fully margined with cash and they have released the a/r and inventory. they can pay "pay as you go severance" during the period (i.e. no lump sum/ and limited to what the person would have received in monthly salary ordinarily). they can also pay any other severance stuff (i.e. $ under employment contract )capped at $500,000. david and elizabeth will turn the docs from last night with some other nits etc. fixed up for last internal look before we send. robert see if we haven't gotten what you have if you would so can keep going. shout back anyone if disagree with above. have just confirmed this list with michael.	2
RE: Winstar Bankruptcy	jane, i think it would be a good idea if you could talk internally at broadband and come up with ONE operations person to contact with respect to any operational issues on distressed/bankrupt counterparties to coordinate at ebs. that person may end up having to talk to a number of people at broadband to coordinate there once decisions are reached. that person could be in charge of getting numbers for proofs of claim, terminating service etc. our rejection stipulation is filed but not signed by judge. i told them to terminate the others before sept. 1 as i recall because we could get out of the other side without damages. it was even pulled out of the book....	2

Otherwise, we could be revising the 2 documents in parallel. I am planning to get the short draft WSPP Collateral Annex over to you today.	1
Re: administrative claims-pg & e	Lisa, I am comfortable that the order setting the administrative claim bar date applies only to claims arising from the post-petition sale of power through the CAISO. My understanding, based on an email from John, is that power sales under bilateral contracts, such as the EPMI power contract, do not go through the ISO. Assuming that is correct (and if John or Elizabeth disagree, please let me know immediately), I am comfortable that there is no need to file an administrative claim for power sales under the EPMI contract for the period April 6 to April 9. Similarly, the post-petition negative CTC claim does not arise from the sale of power through the ISO. Thus, there is no need to file an administrative claim for it at this time.	2

FW: APS Transmission Invoice	Tim and Steve, As mentioned by Tim, another alternative would be to not make the prepetition payment and just use the market to settle these obligations. If the cost of the payment is factored into the cost of the transmission and compared to the cost of a market settlement, the company would benefit by not making the prepetition payment for approximately the next 32 days worth of deliveries. After this time the company would incur additional costs to deliver at Pinnacle Peak for the remaining term of the WALC obligation. The term of the WALC agreement is through 12/31/04 and is in the money during LLH for the entire term.	2
RE: APS Transmission Invoice	Tim We are currently using APS transmission to satisfy a LLH short position at Pinnacle Peak. The revenue associated with the sale at Pinnacle Peak is $45/MWh. The transmission is used to liquidate a long position at Four Corners 345 against the Pinnacle Peak short position. The cost of the power purchased at Four Corners is $22.25/MWh. Using the APS transmission is the most economic liquidation scheme at this time. Our alternative would be to sell the length below the market value, and buy the short at above market value. This assumes that we could find a willing buyer and seller. The spread between the purchase and sell price in this scenario is estimated at $5/mwh. The cost of the APS transmission is $1.95/mwh. Salt River has the facility to provide the same service, but at this time they are unwilling to provide service to Enron. If you have any further questions please contact me.	2

Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy	Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE. 1. Form Enron Negotiation Team My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich. My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this. Jeff should only be there to make introductions. 2. Meet & Confer (10/29) Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens. 3. Reformed Stipulation I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document. Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride. 4. Meeting My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday. Can everyone make it that needs to be there? Probably meet in California. We should put the laundry list on the table. Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees. Thanks, Jim	1
RE: Shell - hope I am not to late	Pete, You weren't too late and John conveyed the message to Roy Reardon our mediator. I talked with John and the phone call with Reardon turned out to be each side giving their story--King went first and took about 30 minutes which Gardiner happily listened to. I'll let Gardiner give you the details tomorrow, but the upshot was as follows (please sit down and resist punching the screen): 1. Shell came into the deal at $494 with outside lending for 70% and only 30% equity. From Nov. 2000--Mar.2001 there was a dramatic budget increase that caused Shell concern because the numbers didn't make sense. 2. Enron owes Shell a fiduciary duty of full & frank disclosure, good faith, honesty. 3. The turnkey contract with SCC for a lump sum of $398 "gave Shell great comfort" because SCC had to complete the project timely or pay delay damages. 4. Shell was not consulted about the increase from $494 to $621. (!?) (Go figure....) 5. What angered shell the most, was the manner in which we tried to impose the $688 budget for their failure to object. (While this could be true it is not a terribly sympathetic argument because the project companies needed money). 6. Shell believes SCC should have to bear these costs. 7. "Shell will prove that the A&R contract did not have Shell's consent." ???? 8. Even though Shell bought in, they were never treated properly as a partner in the project and were consistently excluded. (Calm down Laine!) 9. Now that gas is at the plant, the turbines are broken and we're not earning money. The turbines broke because we used the wrong fuel, "somebody left tools in GT12," and we "released Siemens from their warranty." (never mind that it expired...). The more of these ridiculous arguments they make, the better for us, so Gardiner is going to encourage Shell to go first. We'll discuss tomorrow. Regards, Michelle	2
In re Doyle Claim Against Underwriters	I recently heard from David Marshall in the Risk Management Group that we may have made or were contemplating a claim against Ron Anderson of IBC Turbo for misrepresenting the quality of the gas turbines that he procured for us. Marshall said that you were the person who would know. Anderson is a potentially crucial witness for us if we decide to pursue Underwriters on the insurance claim arising out of the failure of the Doyle Unit #1, which is one of the gas turbines that he procured for us and that was located in Monroe, Georgia at the Doyle plant. Are you the man I need to talk to? I know you are underwater. Is there anyone else who would know about this?	1
RSM v. El Paso	This will update you on the matters discussed during the joint defense c= onference call held this afternoon: =091. One defendant group has approached the plaintiff's lead attorney reg= arding a non-suit prior to the December 5 deadline for moving, answering or= otherwise pleading, but has heard nothing. Others intend to do so before = December 5 as well. I am trying to quickly wrap up my due diligence on Int= ratex, and once that is done, plan to approach the plaintiffs for a non-sui= t of at least Enron Corp. and, depending on the results of the due diligenc= e, on Intratex as well. EGM has still not been served to our knowledge. =092. After discussion, counsel for the defendant holding companies have a= greed to file on December 5 bare-bones motions to transfer venue to Harris = County, with the intention of waiving them if plaintiffs appear disposed to= push back on them. This is because of the problem I mentioned in my earli= er e-mail today with a venue challenge opening the defendants up to discove= ry on the merits of the "in concert" allegations. I will be drafting a pro= posed motion to transfer venue for at least Enron Corp., and will circulate= it among the defendants for them to use as a guide. I may also draft a mo= tion to sever (one is arguably necessary for a motion to transfer venue to = be effective in a case like this), although it too would be bare-bones. On= e of the three required grounds for a motion to sever is that the severed a= nd the remaining causes must not be so intertwined as to involve the same f= acts and issues. Accordingly, I see pursuing a motion to sever on behalf o= f Enron Corp. to be highly problematic as well. =20 =093. All agreed to join in a motion to require Grynberg to show authorit= y. I have previously e-mailed you a draft prepared by F&J. We see no down= side to filing it and considerable upside, such as using it at least to blo= ck discovery by Grynberg until it is resolved. Please let me know if I hav= e your authority to sign the motion. It will be filed no earlier than Dece= mber 6, and expressly subject to earlier-filed motions to transfer venue. =094. I will be working on a plea to the jurisdiction, answer, and affirma= tive defenses to file on behalf of Enron Corp and Intratex, subject to any = motion to transfer venue, and will circulate them to you for your review an= d approval. During the conference call, I raised the issue of adding a spe= cial exception to the effect that the petition fails to state a claim, whic= h is the proper procedural vehicle for what is essentially a Rule 12(b)(6) = motion under the Texas Rules.

Watkins Outage	I just talked to Chris Kennedy, she informed me that Amoco will be taking down their liquids line that feeds the Wattenberg plant for the entire months of August and September. What that means is that the gas flows into CIG at Watkins/Box Elder will be reduced. She says by 15% but I don't know if that's entirely correct. This hurts us on the Thermo deal, delivered to Skyline, due to the fact that these two receipt points are the only points that work on our discounted transportation. I don't think we will have too much trouble buying DJ supplies during the peak of the summer but keep your eyes open for any Watkins/Box Elder supply. We also need to start working CIG for a discount on other receipt points. Paul PS Make sure if you are using the CIG Skyline DISCOUNTED transportation at receipt points other than Watkins and Box Elder we are requesting discounts for these additional points. Otherwise we will be paying max rate!	2
RE: FW: Rehearing on PG&E's GRC Strategies of Both Companies	Thanks, Rick. I received your voicemail as well. I am around (SF) all day tomorrow and look forward to discussing your thoughts. Thanks for your kind words today. I will continue to seriously contemplate my decision.	1
RE: RTO Week Comments	My thoughts -- 1. Focus more on Tariff standardization (I think that this is the key issue for Enron because LMP based bid balancing market is almost a done deal - and the Texas market seems to be fine for liquidity). Build around a new proforma with a NETWORK PLUS model. 2. I would highlight that size matters - re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments. 3. I would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source/sink requirement. 4. The gas / power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration (ie, CNG) but because of the geographic reach. Many LDCs used Columbia p/l, but only one LDC uses AEPs. The electric market needs transmission to be "rationalized" across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at. 5. Should we attack the 209 Boards? Agree that they are unnecessary, but pls be careful. Thanks, Jim	2
Valuation Overview	MWHRs = 4 Years and 1 quarter Flat so that equals approximately 37,250 Hours The difference between 102 (the new amount) and 94.5 (the old average flat amount) = 7.5 MW * 37,250 HRs = 279,375 MWhrs I was under the impression that a 100 MW flat amount would equal $3 million value (a $16 difference between market and $21.50). This would indicate the 102 equals a $4,100,000 valuation. As to the discount in value due to the flexibility and delivery point I am looking to you for leadership. If my assumptions are wrong then let me know.	2
Schedule C	Mike after the calc tonight the NET value of the BPA deal (51353) was 22.8 MM. Therefore we did a schedule c for 22.8MM vs the 25MM we had spoke about. Please advise if you would like to change this.	2
West VaR Reports	VaR for total power has decreased from $41.9 M to $38.7M. VaR for the west desk has decreased from $22.7 to $21 Decrease in var for the west desk is due partially to decrease in intra month vol curves (significant change in Aug component var for the NW-LT and NW-ST books) and decrease in overall short position.	2
RE: Stream Flow Deal	Sanjeev: For your discussions with PacifiCorp we are pricing up the 100% Coullee product only. It didn't appear beneficial to offer a very high price on the multi-stream deal that we really don't have a way to hedge. Glenn is looking into the dual trigger pricing models that we used a year ago that actually settle vs. the power price trigger rather than 100% of the power value. This should be less expensive and more appropriately match PacifiCorp's risk exposure (i.e. combination of low water, high prices). Good luck with the meeting.	2
Northwest Reserves	We currently have $21.4 million in reserve for potential Northwest refunds. $10 million currently sits in the LTCA book and $11.4 currently sits in the LTNW book. During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001. Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI. The claims totaled close to $100 million. However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious. For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding. We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process. One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market. That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk. I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million. We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million. In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC. The draft decision recommended against any refunds. This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year. If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves.	2
Data Problems	Paul, I have been doing some analysis and have found a few problems that should be looked at. 1. The number Mother data is pulling for Zone P is wrong. The pointer for the data can be found on the SQL worksheet the expression is: avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'DAYAHEAD', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_DA, and avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'HOURLY', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_RT, I have looked at the PJM and NY prices and am unable to figure out where the number is coming from. 2. The other 24hr desk evidently has been told that the PJM night shift is to prep the PJM and Nepool portions of the shift notes. That is fine with me. I wrote a macro to pull, format and print the Nepool information. The PJM information is not available on the website. The East power portal has something. I think it does some kind of Op Sum pull at some unknown interval. The problem is the information is not accurate. Rob Bensen's frustration with this bad information is the main reason the other 24hr desk doesn't want any part of the reporting. 2.a All data points are different than the one hour averages calculated in edata. This makes me doubt that opsum is the source, as edata also pulls from opsum. 2.b When all interfaces and hubs are printing the same, the prices shown differ in the same hour on the website. I have no idea where this information is coming from but it is not right. If the correct data can be found there is an application that pulls from the database at "M:\Electric\24hour\PJM AVE\PJMSummary.exe". If they could fix this app I would care less about the web site. If they do not want to fix the app I can write a macro to pull the same data from the mother data template. I don't really care how I get the data, I just need to get yesterday's PJM for the shift note. In other news, if you are trading some of the regular products, are you following the DA-RT physical moves? If we do man the 24hr desk (even if Bryce is the day guy) we could cover the DA-RT physical. Having it part of the 24hr desk would seem to make sense because the evening load and more up to date weather forecasts could be used when entering the NY side in the early morning. I only mention this if you are finding yourself too busy trading PJM to spend the same amount of time on the analysis. It is certainly easier to do uninterrupted analysis on the back shift. Just a thought.	2
E: Data Problems	Paul, I don't doubt that the PJM summary has improved, as I have been pulling the data directly from edata instead of using the website. I will begin to record the difference and will talk with the web data folks in an attempt to understand where they are pulling the data. I have been using the updated website. I spot checked the Zone P prices and there were few errors of little consequence. As for the NE physical, I was doing some analysis and unless I have my directions backwards 24to6 has been a pretty solid play. On the DAP to DAW and DAP to RTW. DA to RT has even been a pretty decent play during other hours. From the night shift I can't tell if this is not being scheduled because you are busy managing EOL products or if there is some reason I don't have the experience to understand yet. I know this is your book and you will want to keep the earnings. I just noticed the opportunity appears to be there. If you would like we can do some of the analysis and pass it on to you to place the orders. Another idea might be for you to tell us what you want to do in NY and you can decide what to do with it on the day shift. I do not want to step on your turf. At the same time," the times they are a changin'" You have done well with the books you have and as people come and go it is easy to see a scenario where you will be trading more during the day. As you move to use the NE physical book more for hedging, as Gautam has used it. There may be a role for the 24 hour guys to take on more of the speculative portion of the physical market. It would seem to make sense to at least start getting the other guys thinking about that portion of the market by trying any of the ideas in the previous paragraph. It is kind of hard to talk about this over email, I would like to find a time to discuss it.	2
RE: Oct 10th Meeting of Natural Gas Reliability Advisory Group	Frank, I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email. As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, "the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great" . The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days. Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows. If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures. This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G. However, we do support intra-day capacity release.	2
FW: Palo Alto Invoice	The differences we had on Friday were mainly volume related. Correcting the deal in SITARA and UNIFY relates to volume actualizations. It is not pricing related. As we talked about there are still some issues on the redwood gas. Redwood gas is the gas relating to the underdelivereis. In otherwords, when Palo Alto "Burns" less than we actualy schedule on the transport. Presumably we sell this gas to other 3rd parties, and Palo Alto will be reimbursed for the variable transportation. I do not think ther are additional fees we would pay on top of reimburseing them for the variable costs, but I am not 100% certain. Please let me know if ther are any other questions. Thanks	2
FW: Forward Natural gas and Electric Costs	Kim, can you help Merced out with a 10-year PG&E city-gate price assuming a 1/1/2002 start (see message below). I'll get them the electricity price.

Cash Offers For Enron Wind Europe	In the last two days, three private equity firms have told me they would be prepared to make all-cash offers for EW's European operations before December 31. These are Babcock & Brown (London), Alchemy (Frankfurt) and FBR (Washington DC). Based on what I know about Enron Wind, I would bet that the price for the European operations alone would be signicantly more attractive for Enron than the price for the combined US and European operations. I don't want to waste their time if it's too late. What should I tell them?	1

Answer	For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA, a "single sum distribution," in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.	1

FW: draft release	Attached is the most recent press release, as of last night. We held off circulating because we anticipated an updated draft but have not yet received one so wanted you to have an opportunity to review what we have. Please let me or Mark Palmer know if you have any comments	1
-	1. We can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for Dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated, however if they think it works - fine. We would not want the margin calculated net (it needs to be exclusive of this transaction). If they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement, there is an accounting issue for us. 2. In the East we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools. We are short to them in the pools which clear financially and we have no issues in the pools. So we do not need to do anything. I'll have the west soon. 3. We will have our physical gas position by point soon. We will agree to prepay for all of Dec but we should only pay day by day.	1
DealBench	In addition to the follow-up e-mail from the offsite, I want to explore the possibility that when you click the auction tab on EnronOnline you get DealBench functionality.

Re: Risk cap.	One thought. What about the power trades. How much do we add for those trades?	2
Confirmation: Risk Management Simulation Meeting 11/15/01	I'm not sure if Andy Lewis explained to you what we were working on with Enron. Basically, our team is responsible for creating a performance simulation to replace Enron's Basic Risk Management course. Along with the simulation, a Knowledge System (series of html pages) will be delivered to each learner. This Knowledge System is a series of topics or "chapters" each consisting of content that will help the learner perform throughout the simulation. Think of this as a encyclopedia, where the learner can go to as a source of reference. Topics include, but are not limited to: Hedging Basics, Risk Identification, Swaps, Options, Commodity Fundamentals, and Accounting & Reporting. I've attached the topic outline for Swaps and the practice exercises and graphics section of the Knowledge System for you to review. (See attached file: Framework Swaps_Final.doc)(See attached file: Swaps Graphic ideas and practices_5.doc) Sheri and I are responsible for this Knowledge System and would like your help in the Swaps topic. Specifically, we would like you to help us with practice exercises the learner will complete within the Swaps topic and graphic ideas that will also support the content in this topic. In addition, we are hoping you can provide us with some of the questions that is outlined in the topic outline.(see above) I will still like to meet with you this afternoon at 3:00pm, so let me know what your schedule looks like. Let me know if you have any questions, I can be reached at X5-6687.	2
Reminder: Risk Management Simulation Questions	Thank you for briefly meeting with me on November 15th to discuss the questions we were looking for on the Swaps topic for Crack Spread, BTU and Spark Spread. Per our conversation, you stated that you wanted to go away to work on these practice questions for Crack Spread, BTU and Spark Spread. As you know, we were hoping to receive some of your questions this week. Do you have any idea when you will be able to send them to us or meet with us to help drive these questions out. Let me know if you have any questions!	2
RE: Ontario Update	Rob, Markets My marks show how we believe the market would trade if the market were open today, considering neighboring markets, transmission/wheeling costs, and fuel costs. More of a expected liquidation value vs. the current Ontario market players bids and offers. The market on 3yr 7x24 is being shown by a broker: $46-$48, and on the wholesale side I doubt the bid is actually there, or if so it is only a piece deep (50MW). As a result, I would show an actually two way of $43-$47.50 and be coming from the sell side to the industrial customers who may pay in the $46-$47 range. Peak, my 3yr mark is $52, but given the often bullish nature of new markets, I would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties. Upcoming changes in the Ontario system (Nodal vs. Zonal pricing) would have an effect on these term deals. Staffing and Services Trading On the trading side, I will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off (an analyst and a temp IT programmer for fundies development). Analyst wise, I am interested in bringing Brian Loy back if he is still available. He has a good knowledge of the NUG contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk. As our need for providing IMO Energy and Operating Reserve Services (bidding for specific NUGS and Dispatchable Loads) grows, it may be a good idea to bring Heather Mcillmurray over from the settlements group. I have had initial discussions with Richard Crouch, Paul Devries and Heather on this matter. Origination This is your area of expertise. I would suggest two originators and an analyst. If Dan Dorland is staying, he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team, and being the analyst to assist the OEFC-NUG point personnel (Brian Loy's previous role). IT Implementing the trading and VMS systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue. I would suggest a short term (6mo) contract with Mike Marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the Estate and NETCO on trading and settlements systems (specifically David Posten's VMS team). His location should be in Toronto. Let's get on these issues as soon as possible. On specific personnel, I would have liked to have retained Jeff Borg and Chris Gaffney. Office Space Tembec, our neighbor on this floor, has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space. If that interest remains, we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens (the origination desk/pod, one conference room and storage area, not to include our server room). This would leave us with space for up to 24 people, two conference rooms, & kitchen. As an alternative, we could consider moving upstairs into the Enron Direct location. Potential Conflict of Interest I would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of Estate or UBS relatively soon. Specifically, the group that is leaving here, but will be participating in the Ontario market. UBS Ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential. If personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities, their access to UBS power & gas curves should be restricted. As time becomes available, we should get together and discuss Ontario's business plan.	2
Enron Security	John, Further to the voice message that I left you, I have recalculated the amount of security that would be required if all of the modified direct sales contracts are acknowledged by noon January 4. The calculations are still a bit rough but I thought this spreadsheet would provide you with something to review. I have used a $35 Pool Price in the calculations. Note the additional tabs in the spreadsheet that detail the hourly generation that the Pool has received for SD3 and SD4 . In determining the actual security required, we will need to review the megawatts in the contracts registered in detail once we have the acknowledgements tomorrow. For simplicity I have assumed that everything is base load and I know this is not correct. Once we know exactly what contracts we are looking at, we can fine tune the calculation.	2
Tax Adjustment re Zufferli	Tricia, John has a stock option amount reported on his final pay stub that needs to be adjusted. The amount represents taxes on stock options and restricted stock exercised in 2001. The stock option numbers on the memos sent by PaineWebber are correct, however, the restricted stock exercise should not be reported on the T4 (as per verification by Dave Peters at PriceWaterhouseCoopers on Jan 2/02). Please make the appropriate adjustments so that the T4 is correct and advise me when corrected. Thanks!	2
