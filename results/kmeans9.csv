Greetings	Greetings, Sandra. I hope life will be treating you better over there soon. As you might know, most of EnergyUSA was given pink slips effective over the next 3-6 months. As a result, it is back looking for another job. I was wondering if it would be possible for you to write a letter of recommendation for me? I'm really regretting this leave from Enron now. In my quest for looking for something stable, I ended up fucking myself up. At least I have a few months before our house is finished. Hopefully, I'll have something by then.	2
Summer Enron Internship	Brad, I really don't know where to begin other than just to say it. Enron is having some extremely difficult times now. I have been trying to focus on helping Enron stay together. This is not a good time for you or anyone else to try and seek employment here. I am sorry if I am letting you down. I was only wanting to help. I will always keep you in mind, and hopefully when things turn around here I will be able to address you coming here.	2
Change of Control Provisions	As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron. The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing. Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million. Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989. But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment. Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash. However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment. Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision. I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face. But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders. I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry. Thank you.	1
Co Identifier - business cards	Michelle - We are struggling with the appropriate company identifier for business cards. We are employees of Enron America, however some of our business cards show Enron North America (carryover from days of old), EWS (no longer/or will no longer exist), and some show Enron Corp (International Admin group). Marge Nadasky in Corp Public Relations who deals with the Company logo and Company names on business cards, etc., has indicated that Legal prefers we use the operating company we are part of rather than Enron Corp (piercing the corporate umbrella issue). She did say we could use just plain Enron if we are not part of the corporate group. As part of a network services function which crosses all Enron business units, do you see any problems if we use Enron on business cards? We have several who have changed positions or never had cards and need new ones. Thanks Sheila	2

RE: Consumers 9/01	Wow....that is a real issue, I can only tell you that Martin or Risk should be able to resolve this for you unfortunately, I wasn't doing TCPL and Union that long ago and I know that Darren Espey, who was doing it before me did usually put in the tickets without pricing and then gave the deal tickets to Risk to make sure they put pricing as well as off set ( Withdraw or Inject ) tickets in too. Please do keep me posted. Thanks, Mark	2
Hi	I've thought about you a few times in the last few months, didn't want to intrude upon an already bad situation with my bullshit questions. I'm hearing some pretty depressing stuff from the people I know at ENE. I wish I had the capital to open my own shop.there will be talent and opportunity a plenty on the market soon. I'll ask around.I've got some friends at Duke and Dynegy from B-school, the Gianoucous (spelling??) brothers (John and Dimitri.from elementary school) started their own outfit a while back, and my old man is at Schlumberger and has good contacts in general (if you aren't married to a trading environment). Give me a few days, and I'll be in touch.	2
Layoffs	Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced. When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people. Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today. Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees. In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.

Thanksgiving Holiday	As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday. With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning. This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard. Thank you for your continued dedication. Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends. Happy Thanksgiving. Stan	2
FW: Western Natural Gas Organization	Here is the scoop. What a mess. Thanks for all of your help and advise. Anne -----Original Message----- From: Grigsby, Mike Sent: Monday, July 16, 2001 11:58 AM To: Rangel, Ina; Bike, Anne; Sanchez, Monique; Holst, Keith; Allen, Phillip K.; Ermis, Frank; Tholt, Jane M.; Kuykendall, Tori; Sullivan, Patti; Lenhart, Matthew; South, Steven P.; Gay, Randall L.; Reitmeyer, Jay; Scott, Susan; Tycholiz, Barry Subject: Western Natural Gas Organization Dear Western Region: I would like to thank Phillip Allen for his leadership of the west desk for 2000 and 2001. He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group. Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts. I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately. I would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group. I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward. Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model. The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals. Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill. Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk. We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company. West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward. They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions. Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base. We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings. This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently. The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region. The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region. We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas. This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market. The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities. Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure. We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon. The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader. Sincerely, Michael D. Grigsby West Gas Trading	2
-	To my freinds and colleagues: I have thoroughly appreciated my employment and the many friends I have made here at Enron. These are tough times, and my sympathy goes out to everyone.

Re: Pictures of Grace	I am sure you will be fine, but I guess everybody should be on pins and needles. You don't think they would eliminate any of the trading function, do you? How is the mood today?

Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.	Mark, Long time no see - I hope you're doing well despite the difficult times we're in. Enron Europe Limited entered into administration earlier today, but nobody seems to have much idea or can render any information about the faith of the captioned company and its Nordic power trading business. We are thus pretty much in the dark over here and I wonder if you can you advise us or direct us to somebody that can. Thanks. Martin	2
Board reps	Mark, I wanted to let you know that today will be my last day at Enron. Please remove me from all the boards. I have really enjoyed working with you and my time at Enron. I still can't believe all that has happened. Best of luck to you and your family and I hope we get a chance to work together again someday.	1

Tragedy Claims Life of Enron Employee	As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York. We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight. Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him. Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting. We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support. Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.	2
RE:	Tori, Just to let you know, I spoke to Victor yesterday and he tells me they have already filled the two open positions, but he wants me to forward my resume for future openings.

Apology	Dr. Lay, I just wanted to write to apologize on behalf of whomever sent you those hostile questions. Even though we have some reasons to be angry, we do not have an excuse to be rude or disrespectful, specially to you. I wanted you to know that those acts do not reflect the sentiments of the majority of Enron Employees. We are embarrassed that you even had to address the question on the first place. Please accept this apology and we hope to have you around for a long time, your words of encouragement really makes a difference, thank you. Best regards,	2
Enron Japan is at the entrance of "Bermuda Triangle"!!!	Dear Enron's topmanagement, We are not only concerned on the crashed stock but also Enron's situation in Japan. The business here is too difficult!!! How do you know the current situation here: > Bad Reputation in Japan - if you say you are from Enron people will say "No" > Ignorance of Japanese Business - wasting many time on TOCOM, a market controlled by mafia, those minor comnies want to cheat Enron's money > Unsatisfactory business environment - deregulation will not proceed in three years > Poor manegment - the office is like a kindergarden, the so called "experts" have serious discrimmination with local staff; They do nothing themselves just ask the local "slave" to work hard and they go to vacation or business trip > "Sato" means sweet in Japanese but Sato Project is not so sweet as you think! Have you expected another "E-power"? I have to say we are so dispointed with Enron!!!! Enron Japan is at the entrance of "Bermuda Triangle", we worry when will it dispear?	1
Information	Kenneth, I'm an associate in EES, and I have been working in Enron for two an a half years. First I would like apologies if this causes any inconveniences, but I am writing this email to you because I'm quite concern about the latest news about the partnership/CFO that came out in the last week or so. Me and many of my fellow A/A co-workers as well as other employees do not know what is going on, and speaking for myself, if it's possible for you to let me and everyone else know what the situation is and how are you taking measures to reassure confidence in the marketplace I would greatly appreciate your time. I assure you that many of my fellow A/A co-workers have confidence in the future of Enron, and I expect that greener pastures will be in front of us very soon.	1
Financial Disclosure of $1.2 Billion Equity Adjustment	For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I'm ashamed to admit th= at I work for Enron! I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management a= nd agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Managem= ent can not be trusted. Ethics and Morals are either something everyone el= se needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior= Management started believing the end justifies the means. The communicati= on the Employee's have received over the last few years about values such a= s Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda inten= ded to get Employee's to believe Senior Management really supported these v= alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som= ething just the opposite. I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human n= ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha= ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in= the future. Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with t= he statement "It's just a balance-sheet issue" implies to me that this ind= ividual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certa= inly should not be speaking to the public. If you are going to play the ga= me of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen= t a plausible story. To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua= ting values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other techn= ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini= tion of the word "HEDGE". A hedge by definition implies that the upside an= d downside exposure has been limited. It frightens me that we are out aski= ng customers to let Enron help them "HEDGE" their risk when I'm not sure En= ron's Senior Management understands what a hedge means? I'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i= n the investment vehicle that generated this write down. I must be confuse= d in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I= will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the= Natural Gas Business. This must be an example of as my father used to say= " do as I say not as I do"? I guess we need to have audits performed of Se= nior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as = their word? The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t= ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and = took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin= ion is "CRIMINAL". It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp= etrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months. These individuals= have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and ne= ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity. They are set for life, h= aving all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders = have lost their life savings. You have completely failed at the job you we= re hired to perform. If this type of activity would have occurred farther = down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve= d and to institute criminal charges. =20 I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week. I do not = think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we= trust what is said anyway. Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee's a th= orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what= actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor= mance to date.=20	2
Enron Metals Ltd (Enron Europe Office)	Dear Mr Lay, I write to you as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Enron Corporation because I would like you to know that I am on my second period of sick leave in a year due to work related stress. A year ago I was apologised to by the Human Resources Department and told that they would not allow it to happen again. Through constant pressure and the unfair way in which I have been treated, the advice of my doctor and counsellor, as they are concerned with my health, was to accept the voluntary redundancy which had been offered to my colleagues and myself recently. Though due to my exceptional circumstances I wrote the attached letter. Today I received the attached response and I feel totally devastated that Enron Europe will not compensate me fairly for how they have affected my life and that of my family's. I read in Enron's literature that you care about your employees and their families, and feel that your code of ethics should have offered me protection against the circumstances that I find myself in, but to my complete and utter dismay I find this is not the case and in my experience I have suffered a great deal and this seems to have been totally ignored in the response letter. I haven't once been contacted by Enron Europe to see how I'm coping and give me any support whatsoever. They are showing no care or concern for me or my family. I write to you for help in this matter and to conclude this stressful situation that I find myself in due to your company. Under the circumstances and increased stress that the response letter has put upon me, I would be most grateful if you would respond to me as soon as possible.	2
Defining Debtor and Non-Debtor Companies	Nothing about bankruptcy is easy, and because of Enron's size, ours is especially complex. So it is understandable that there might be confusion among employees of Enron's various debtor and non-debtor companies surrounding the bankruptcy. To clarify, debtor-in-possession, or debtor, companies are the legal entities of Enron that have filed for bankruptcy - their business activities are subject to the review and approval of the Creditors' Committee and the bankruptcy court. Non-debtor companies are legal entities owned or controlled by Enron that have not filed for bankruptcy - for the most part, non-debtor companies are able to operate their business as usual. The estate is made up of the combined assets and liabilities of Enron, which include some holdings in non-debtor companies. It is important to note that at the beginning of March there were approximately 20,000 Enron employees in non-debtor companies, and about 3,500 Enron employees in debtor companies. Distinctions between debtor and non-debtor companies become especially relevant for employees as we begin to roll out components of a transitional compensation program. As we work through restructuring, components of the program will apply differently to employees of debtor and non-debtor companies. For example, earlier this year some non-debtor companies were able to pay performance bonuses and merit increases to their employees as part of the ordinary course of business. Another example is severance. Going forward, we can anticipate gradual reductions in our workforce. Given the uncertainty of our situation, we realize the importance of providing a "safety net." Severance provides employees a degree of financial security in the event their jobs are terminated in the future. Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute a new severance plan for their employees. This was possible because the plan did not require the approval of the bankruptcy court. While the severance plan for debtor companies will be different than the plan for non-debtor companies, severance is part of a comprehensive retention and severance plan that will go to the bankruptcy court for approval. Employees of debtor companies will be covered by either severance or retention. Retention will become part of the compensation program for some employees, primarily those in debtor companies. Retention offers employees an incentive to stay with the company to help develop a new business entity, to liquidate non-core assets, or to unwind the affairs of the estate. Retention is not a measure of past performance, but is intended to retain key employees whose skills or historical knowledge are critical to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors. Additionally, we are now finalizing merit increases and promotions for employees of debtor companies. Supervisors in those companies will soon begin communicating merit increases or promotions to their employees. We hope this information further clarifies the bankruptcy's impact on our individual businesses, but more importantly, we hope it helps to establish realistic expectations and reduce some uncertainty for you as employees.

What's up with your company?!	Dude, Good thing I took some of my Pru 401K $$ and bought Enron in February, when I opened my roll-over IRA. Besides the job how's everything else going with you and the lovely Lisa? Things could not be more hectic over here. I'm switching jobs next month. Gave the dot.com world a shot and timed it wrong. When the company you are working for is borrowing $$ from the VC to meet payroll and has not locked in the final round of funding, you know it is time to move along. Will be joining a NY Real Estate Brokerage House, where I'm friend with the guys. Will be helping them run their Corporate Service Group. Lets see what else is going on. Chrissy is trying to decide if she is going to volunteer for the Merrill Lynch layoff package that is being offered. I want her to, because her boss is making her life miserable. My father had triple by-pass surgery last month. He is doing fine now and it is probably for the better in the long run that he had the procedure done. And on good note- My brother got engaged. I lost Mr. Conway's tele # and email address, can you shoot it over to me. Would like to drop him a message. Is he still State side? hopefully. Remember to drop me a note when you finalize your visit back to NJ in January, so we can hook up. Tell Lisa and the family that we send our regards,	2
RE: the long knives come out	Financial sorcery seems to be the key concept. Whereas most trading companies live in mortal fear of the rogue trader, and I honestly think Enron has built controls to prevent this specie from flourishing here, we seem to have been infected with a rogue financial sorcery cell, a small group of highly persuasive individuals who mesmerized the Board and the Street to a most memorable degree. What do shareholders do when their Board has been hypnotized by the CEO and CFO? It's ugly. ----cgy	2

Holiday Party - Canceled	I know that this is a difficult time for all of us. With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year. To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed. Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season. Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances. After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8. Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event. I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more. We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season. Ken Lay	2
