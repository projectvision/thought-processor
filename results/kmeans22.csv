University of Houston Law Center	Dear Mr. Lay, I first wanted to thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail. I know that you are extremely busy and receive numerous requests on a daily basis. I have been an employee with Enron for almost two years. I have spent most of my time on the Liquids trading floor as a Risk Manager for the financial crude book. I was recently recruited by Fred Lagrasta to work in his midmarketing group. I am responsible for supporting our originators in New York. My years at Enron have taught me not only the business aspects of the energy industry, but to strive to pursue your dreams and accept nothing but the best from yourself. It has been a dream of mine to attend law school since I was little. II feel like I am at the time in my life that I can sucessfully pursue this dream. I am interested in studying corporate law at the University of Houston Law Center and participating in their part-time program while maintaining my employment with Enron. I recently spoke with Don Schroeder, a physical crude trader here at Enron, who suggested sending you an e-mail asking if you would be so kind as to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf. I would be honored if you would write the university a letter recommending me to their part-time program. I am hoping to make the early decision deadline of November 1st. I understand that you do not know me at all, however I would be more than willing to come visit with you if you had time and/or forward you my resume and performance evaluations. I know that I would represent Enron well by attending the University of Houston. I worked full-time throughout my college career at Texas A&M University to help finance my education. I am a hard worker and take pride in everything that I do. I know that I will be successful in law school as well as excel with my career at Enron. Again, I greatly appreciate you taking the time to read this request and your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.	1

Management & Leadership	Ken, Greg, Mark - Thank you for your leadership over the last several weeks and this morning. We appreciate it. Following are some additional thoughts and some more detail on my comments from this morning: The leadership group in that room needs to feel the sense of responsibility to lead our businesses. Everything we say & do - including all written, verbal and "body language" - are signals. We must communicate and lead all day, every day. As an organization, and as part of our culture, we lead with our chin - always have and probably always will. We are going to take our share of bumps and bruises. We have some great businesses here....and we are fortunate. We have grown the size and profitability of our core businesses substantially, and in a market where many companies have not been as successful. Most of our wounds are self - inflicted. We can and should do a better job. I believe this leadership team needs to make an absolute commitment in the following areas: Vision - define what we want this company to be in the next 3-5 years Value - as part of building the World's Leading Company, my vote is that we dedicate our energy towards building long term, sustainable value. This is not about just creating value in the eyes of Wall Street - this is about creating real value, perhaps as defined by "after tax operating profit minus the real cost of capital". Market cap will follow this type of economic value creation. We need to measure it and incent people this way. Teamwork - we are a leadership team. I don't feel as though everyone buys into that nor is it clear that everyone around that table feels a sense of responsibility to lead across the business. I would like to discuss how we improve as a team. Many of our employees (at an average age of 33 years) have never been through: an economic downturn a global military conflict problems like the ones we are currently experiencing at Enron We need big time leadership now....from all who are around that table Clear Demonstration of our leadership - in clear view of our employees, customers and shareholders People - we must make sure to retain and enhance the interest of the employees that add value to Enron everyday. These people need to believe - with our actions - that we are absolutely focused on making sure they have an environment that is conducive to building and creating value over the short, medium and long term. The ball is in our court. We have to lead and be perceived as credible leaders. We've got to dig deep and get down the road - together. If you wish, I would be pleased to discuss this further. Thank you again for your leadership. Regards - Dan	0
Belated congrates to a classmate	Just a short note to congratulate you on your success at Enron. I had an email written shortly after your promotion but then the 9/11 shi* happened and I lost track of it. Well now that you guys are back in the news quite a bit I figured that I should at least send you a note. Even considering the issues currently facing Enron, I am sure you will emerge strong and better than before- you always had a knack for that at school and I am sure it will continue now. We started down the track of doing business with you guys (in the areas of financial products and insurance) but I don't know how the upcoming merger will effect that. Just found out that my plebe year Squad Leader Ricky Waddell (Rhodes Scholar and Academic All American in football) works for you in S. America. Great guy! Are you thinking of going to the Army/Navy game? Two ranked teams!!! I am heading back with John Heller (the football player not the swimmer). He has a skybox and we might have some extra tickets so let me know. Best of luck and I look forward to catching up with you.	1
