Enron Metals North America Voluntary Severance	Michele, Per our telecon, the timeline to roll out the VR for Metals North America has been escalated to THURSDAY, October 18th which only leaves us tomorrow to try and tie up loose ends. Attached 'NA Metals Analysis' spreadsheet will give you all the demographics of our population, include, ethnicity, gender, age, etc. please note the 'standard' tabe includes everyone on Enron standard at-will employment letters. The second tab 'agreement' has all our people on exec agreements. The 'BU Briefing to Staff' will give you a good general overview of the program that was rolled out in EEL, I've red-lined the document to tweak it to the US side. The employee info packet will include 'Enron Metals Change Program' document, 'VR Application' and 'FAQS.' Again I've red-lined these EEL originated documents to fit the US side. There are still some oustanding items I need to confirm with Comp & Ben. My immediate questions are: Will our current severance policy allow us to provide an enhanced voluntary program? We want to offer it to all employees. Can we do this and still reserve the right to reject applications? If we do reject applications under the Voluntary Program will we be prevented from terminating the employee under the compulsory program? Do we need to make any special consideration for employees on maternity leave ( I have three!!). Please call me when you've had reviewed these items so we can determine how quickly we can move forward. Thanks Cathy	1
follow-up	Michelle- I hope that this message finds you well and that you are having a great week. I spoke with Mark Broadfoot this afternoon and he suggested I try to reach you through e-mail.

If you could please let us know where that stands, or if you have any feedback and/or questions it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks and have a great evening.	0

-	Would you mind checking into something for me? One of our lawyers was called by someone from Industrial Markets who was laid off. He indicated that he had an employment contract that has a six month non-compete for involuntary termination. He said that he called HR to get a waiver of the non-compete so that he could pursue new employment and was told that no waiver would be granted. Is that our policy or are these issues being addressed on a case by case basis? I find it hard to believe that we would even think about enforcing a non-compete for someone we've laid off, so why not grant the waiver? If this is not the policy, we need to get this straightened out.	1
FMLA Policy	As you know, Sarah is on her honeymoon now, so I am trying to tie up all loose ends with regard to the FMLA and Sick Leave Policy. I would appreciate it if you would read the following documents and let me know if we have the "go ahead" to proceed. We are beginning to work on a very tight deadline here since we need to give the appropriate notice to all employees. After reading the FMLA policy, do you think that we need to have links that explain ADA and Workers Comp? If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let me know.	2
Severance	Can we use credited service date for sev calc? I have a person who was hired in 1997, left in 1999 and was rehired in April 2001. The system is using a 1998 service date for severance. I calculated in on the 2001 re hire date.	1

RE: ISDA North American Energy and Developing Products Committee	Stacy: It occurred to me that members of the North American Energy and Developing Products Committee might be interested in participating in a discussion about one of the changes to the Ontario Market Rules that is currently being considered by the Board of Directors of the IMO (the Independent Electricity Market Operator in Ontario). The Ontario Market Rules have, to date, been designed such that generators of electricity will receive a 5 minute price (EMP or energy market price) from the IMO, and consumers of electricity receive an hourly price (the HOEP or hourly Ontario energy price). The HOEP was calculated as the weighted average of the EMP for an hour. For a variety of reasons, the IMO has now decided to change the way that the HOEP is calculated, such that it will be the straight average of the EMP's for the hour. Customers have already entered into swaps, fixing the price at which they will purchase electricity, in which they pay a fixed price and receive the HOEP in return. Therefore, if the quantum of the HOEP is now different than is was based under the formula in effect when the contract was entered into, the economics of the deal have changed. It's not clear at this time how material this change in calculation will be. Will it make a $0.05 difference to the HOEP, or a $3.00 difference to the HOEP? In other words, is it a Material Change in Formula? Let me know if you think this might be of interest to the members. Meg	2

EcoElecrica / Possible Mirant Offset	All: I understand that Mirant, the buyer in our EcoElectrica deal, may have some outstanding trading exposure with Enron and/or its affiliates. The issue has been raised of whether Mirant may attempt to offset amounts to which Mirant believes it is entitled against the $266 million purchase price that Mirant is obligated to pay an Enron affiliate in the EcoElectrica deal. I understand that Enron has netting agreements in place with certain counterparties which may permit such offsets. Which lawyer in the Enron trading world can help me determine what, if any, contractual arrangements are in place with Mirant that bear on this important issue? Pls let me know.	1

MISO Losses - News and an Important Question	Good news. It sounds like MISO will offer a way to handle losses financially. Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially. I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine. Now, for the Important Question. MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15. I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path). If this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP. Also let me know how prevalent that practice is. MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15. While they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline, they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem. Thanks,	1
Curtailments of Stacked Transmission	Attached is a presentation for your review that illustrates a new method for curtailment of transactions that is still based on CPM, but give partial-credit for varying levels of firmness in a stack. As you probably know, when a transaction leg is supported by multiple transmission reservations it is referred to as a "stack" of transmission; specifically, a vertical stack. Under the current curtailment procedures under which we operate, such a stack is always valued at the LOWEST curtailment priority of the stack. In other words, if I combine 50MW of firm transmission and 50MW of Non-Firm Secondary, my 100MW of transmission capacity is now treated as if it ALL had a curtailment priority of 1. Further, if an off-path constraint occurs, the entire transaction is treated with a priority of 1, even if every other leg is Firm. As I'm sure you can see, this stinks. So I have drafted up a proposal for what I think is a better way of doing this. Under the proposal, 50MW would be treated as priority 1, while the other 50 would be treated as Firm. This would reduce the SIZE on-path curtailments and off-path curtailments. As far as whether it increases or decrease the NUMBER of transactions curtailed, that will depend on several different factors (how prevalent stacking is, how often stacks vary in firmness, etc...). Please review and give comments, as I plan to present to the IDCWG in a few weeks. It is my opinion that this is a good idea, but I want to make sure you all (and any others you think should be asked) agree.	1

re: Starwood Questions	Bill, I hope your new job is treating you well. Sorry to bother you but I had two more questions regarding Starwood that I am hoping you can answer. They both regard the DSM projects. 1. If Starwood chooses not to use their own capital for DSM projects, is EES obliged to provide lease financing? 2. Related to the above, if we are obliged, are we limited in the rate we can charge? i.e. Could we charge a "discouraging" rate? The language in the MLA Section 2.2 seems to be adequately vague that if we were having trouble raising capital ourselves, we could pass those costs through as "such other factors as are customarily considered by lessor parties providing lease financing for similar equipment and terms." These questions came up when RAC looked at our summary documentation. I am hoping these are quick questions for you. Please let me know. Thanks again, Chris	1

One of my "marching orders" is that choice of law provisions in EES paper should require Texas law. The Edison form opts for New York. Is this something that can be changed? Second, what about more substantive matters, such as who takes the lead in sending transaction confirmations? In the A'lones transaction, it is contemplated that EES will be the Buyer. The Edison form places primary confirmation obligations on the Seller. I am informed that EES prefers to be the confirming party, regardless of whether it is the buyer or seller. Is this something that can be changed? Third, there are a variety of typographical and reference errors. i.e. double commas (see paragraph 2.2), doubled phrases (paragraph 5.1(h)(i)), and possibly mistaken use of defined terms (see use of "Product" in second line of paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2). What is the Company's position on correcting these types of items? I apologize that this is being e-mailed, as it would probably be quicker by phone, but my connection to the phone system is lagging somewhat behind my connection to the computer network. Thank you for your time and attention.	1

RE: PG&E	I would ask Mike about the last sentence in bullet 5. Based on the language of the quote the Commission appears to be referring to the surcharge "adopted in D. 01-03-082." Was the .01 surcharge "adopted" in that proceeding? Maybe I am reading this too literally. I do agree that the rationale for exempting DA customers from the 3 cent surcharge applies equally to the 1 cent surcharge, and that we should continue to strive for this clarification at the CPUC (which Sue Mara is handling). Sue, I am forwarding this to you for your comments.	1

Recording of conversations	Richard: Robert Knight said that you might be able to provide me some guidance regarding the legal issues involved in the recording of conversations. A group within EES is requesting recording telephone conversation, and want the ability to playback from their desktop. I explained to them that to my understanding there were some legal issues involved, and I needed to get clarification. They were under the impression, that since their requirements are different from the traders requirements for recording, they didn't think it applied. Could you shed a little light on Enron's policy, or if this is something that should be deferred to someone within EES legal, who might that person be? Any help you could offer would be very much appreciated. Thanks for your time. Regards, Kathy	1

SLUMP CBS.MarketWatch.com, 11/27/01 Enron In Free Fall Forbes.com Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers,But Still Trading By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 11/27/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. "It's not getting any better," said one major energy broker. Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. "They've been cut off from so many people," said one electricity trader. Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. "We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility," Thode said. Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating "evolving." Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com (John Edmiston in Houston and Jon Kamp in Chicago also contributed to this article.) Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: UPDATE 3-Dynegy says in talks on Enron merger structure. By C. Bryson Hull 11/27/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp. over their proposed merger, as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some 40 percent. "I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal," Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters. He declined to give further details. Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is currently in a "due diligence" examination of Enron's complex financial books that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday. The buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about $10.41 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to near $4, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all. The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of 0.2685 of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to around 0.15 instead, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Enron is willing to accept the lower valuation, given the pressure on its stock price, the sources said. Enron's shares bounced on Dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks, trading up 22 cents at $4.23 in late afternoon action on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had dipped as low as $3.84 in late-morning dealings and as high $4.49. Dynegy's shares gained 4.7 percent or $1.83 to move to $41.08 on the NYSE. Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt past the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002. The sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $500 million in cash, which Enron has said it was seeking. There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which would be Dynegy's consolation prize if the deal fell apart, a source said. Published reports have said that investment banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans, and may dispute Dynegy's ownership if the deal breaks up. "The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized. There's a solid earnings stream from that thing," said one source familiar with the discussions. ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off. Enron was not immediately available for comment. Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyout, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise. Enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactions with North America's largest energy trader because of credit concerns. "This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the principal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less then Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business," said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade. But as Enron's stock continued to lose value, down over 50 percent since Dynegy's initial bid, it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well. Enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $3 billion, from $60 billion at the start of 2001. (additional reporting by Jeff Goldfarb, Janet McGurty and Jonathan Stempel in New York).

All Rights Reserved. Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms By Christina Cheddar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 11/27/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky. Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt. Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%. Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price. According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion. The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said. As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion. Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer. But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way. Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy. Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. "There's nothing like accounting to scare people," said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron is also trying to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings to stem a growing liquidity crisis, the Wall Street Journal said. lwl/gc Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price 11/27/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said. At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51. The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98. Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks. Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd. As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised. The current agreement with Dynegy contains a "material adverse change" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off. As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. "Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is," said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co. Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse. "The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars," said Gheit. If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd. blms/cl/gc Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms By Carol S. Remond 11/27/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate. And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader. Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal. "We're trying to figure out a good play," said a trader at a New York hedge fund. So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds. "People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it," a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, "We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides." Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price. Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. "Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds," said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds. Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday. Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share. Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds. When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount. Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15. "A lot of the guys are still very skeptical," said a bond trader at a New York bank. "But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds." Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position. "We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive," the manager of a large New York hedge fund said. Carol S.

Dynegy Confirms Talks On Enron Deal Structure - Source By Christina Cheddar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 11/27/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enron Corp. (ENE). "I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal," said John Sousa. "I can't elaborate any further at this time." An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment. Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report. Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%. Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share. The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion. While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent. Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron "locked down" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses. Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said. If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from "pending"' or "threatened" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked. In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com The discussions between Enron and Dynegy aren't merely focused on revising the consideration Dynegy will pay. They are also aimed at providing Enron with additional funding and at restructuring its debt, said a person familiar with the negotiations. The moves are aimed at restoring confidence in Enron and relieving "the perceived liquidity crisis," the source said. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Shares of financially troubled energy trading giant Enron Corp. slipped back into the red on Tuesday after gaining in opening trade following news of a new rescue deal from Dynegy Inc. . Enron shares were down 2 cents at $3.99 after rising 19 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $4.20 in early dealings on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts questioned the viability of the original proposal for Dynegy to acquire Enron in a deal worth about $9 billion. The Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were discussing reducing the price of the all-stock deal by more than 40 percent, to about $5 billion. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says 2001-11-27 16:12 (New York) Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action today on the largest energy trading company. David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings communication, said although there was speculation in the market that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment. Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader in private equity. Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B. Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an acquisition by Dynegy Inc. Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle 2001-11-27 15:16 (New York) Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers, seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP. ``I was approached by several people to invest in the company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined 95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good investment, he said. Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B. Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an acquisition by Dynegy Inc. The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing, jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take place. Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about 55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5 percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years. Declining to Invest J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments, which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more than two weeks. Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We are not in discussions with Enron about financing.'' ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet, which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her portfolio invested in Dynegy shares. Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people close to the discussions. Terms ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers the energy market for Deutsche Bank. Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.'' Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings to 75 cents a share from $1.65. Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships. Cash Question ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash position of the company stabilizing or not?'' Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the developments. Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks 2001-11-27 11:56 (New York) Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader. Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he helps manage at Liberty. Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said yesterday. ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just waiting.'' ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to resuscitate Enron back to health.'' A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks 2001-11-27 11:00 (New York) St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader. Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and doesn't own shares of either company. The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a renegotiated bid, Heim said. ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the deal to have real value.'' Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron 2001-11-27 10:42 (New York) New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader. Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said yesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares. ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that Enron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, is deteriorating,'' Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of the business, Meade said. Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billion before partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said. A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business has fallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meade said. A New York Times report that banks may extend payments on some loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concern that Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities of Enron,'' Meade said. ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMP By Lisa Sanders CBS.MarketWatch.com 4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001 HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4 a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant is working with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer. Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season, added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. The stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday. Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89. The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enron are renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock. According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business -- energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story. Getting it done _______________________________________________________________________ Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, said it's a "crapshoot" as to whether the deal gets done. "I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good position for the long-term," he said. His fund liquidated its Enron holdings completely in mid to late-October. "Enron was the leader (in energy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot to take up the mantle." Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potential triggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two things could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens, Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility. "Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the few that could make something out of it," Hilton said. "If Dynegy can restore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern Natural Gas, it looks like it might be worth the headache." Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline system, whether the merger goes through or not. Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through a company spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with "the parties involved in the transaction" related to the structure of the deal. Top Of The News Enron In Free Fall Dan Ackman <javascript:newWindow('Ackman')>, Forbes.com <http://www.forbes.com/news>, 11.27.01, 9:00 AM ET NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stands, it's a minor scandal. The Houston-based energy company, whose Chairman Kenneth Lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for President George W. Bush <http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/12/gwbush.html> and Vice President Dick Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by rival Dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling. Dynegy's (nyse: DYN <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=DYN> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=DYN> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=DYN>) buyout of Enron (nyse: ENE <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=ENE> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=ENE> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=ENE>) was originally valued at $9 billion. But just as the deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years. While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believe it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 billion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago. The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, several top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive officer, left in August for "personal reasons." Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreement that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exercise of stock options in 2000 alone. For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with 2000 revenue of $101 billion. Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the company's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills. The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and that number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their ratings on Enron debt. Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco (nyse: CVX <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=CVX> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=CVX> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=CVX>), may pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase goes through. But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close. Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself. Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. It says it "markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world." While all this may be true, its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing revenue--much like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors. Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that revenue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. Most of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm. Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball season, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. By 2002, Enron Field may need a new name. The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but it means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company Enteron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron means "intestines;" they decided to drop the "te" in the middle and go with Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in terms of revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.	1
