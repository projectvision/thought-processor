Third Quarter Earnings Results	Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43. This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines. In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002. We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter. Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance. We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units. In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units. For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities. In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services. This quarter they are reported separately. Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately. Following are the highlights of our businesses: Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter. Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d). Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million. Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh). Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year. While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat. Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago. So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers. Transportation and Distribution: Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter. Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago. This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter. Last week, we announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural. This transaction is expected to close next year. Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind. Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year. Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year. This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs. Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago. In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion. Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core businesses. These charges include: ? A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ? $183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services. This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers. ? $544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement. With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things: 1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Natural Gas Origination	Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers. In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Jane Beatty letter & contract	Michelle, Will you please review the attached and initial if you approve the way it reads? We technically hired Jo Crowder as our first hire, but didn't see the sense in paying the remaining $20K of her $50K retainer fee for someone who is at a Staff level. I've discussed this arrangement with Jane and she is in agreement. (Twanda, do you mind printing this on EGM letterhead for Michelle to initial? I'm happy to come pick it up, or you can send to me at ECN 3678a. Thanks!) Additionally, we would like to extend Jane's contract so she can continue to submit candidates to us. Her original contract ended on September 30th. We'd like to extend it for a six month term beginning October 1st, continuing through March 31st. I've spoken with Jane and she agrees that there will not be an additional retainer fee charged to us by reinstating our contract. (Diane, is this as easy as just running new executable copies of the contract, changing only the dates or would we just create a one page amendment to the existing contract for signature by all parties?). We would like to continue working with them under the same fee structure as though our contract with them never ended (i.e. our next hire will be at a 25% fee). Thanks for your help, ladies! Let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist!	1
RE: Pulp and printing & writing presentation - Facts & Figures	WOW! This is a great industry overview. I haven't vetted the numbers, and I understand Karen wants to sit down and go over it in detail, but it appears to be exactly what we wanted and a great tool. Of course it will always be a work in progress, being improved and updated as we get better information. Good work.	0
Daily Update	Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating. We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations. The pipelines are not being sold. Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line. Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence. We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate. This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash. I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company. On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read: <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>. This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron. Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>). Thank you.	1

ADL Luncheon	Jim, Well, you finally gave a speech that topped the one you gave at Linda's and my rehearsal dinner. You did an outstanding job (as did Carrin), and it was obvious you were speaking from the heart. I know you would prefer not to have all of this attention, but it comes with the territory. It sure made me proud to see you up there, and congratulations on the accomplishment. Scotty	2
Enron Law Conference	Jim, I am so glad that the 2001 law conference went so well -- we have received many favorable comments from the attendees. Today we had a post-conference meeting with the group that worked on the conference, and we went over what worked well and what didn't. It was very productive. One of the things that came out of our meeting was the need to promptly appoint next year's Chairman of the CLE committee. Michelle feels that putting that person in place now will greatly aid in the transition from this year to next year's planning. As a matter of fact, she is meeting with her committee for the last time next week and would love to announce the new chair at that time. So, could you please think about to whom you would like to give that distinct honor? I've asked Michelle to e-mail you information about her committee and her suggestions regarding a chair. Thanks so much for your help and input.	2
Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update	Gentlemen - Following the Dabhol dictate that "bad news is good news," Dabhol is getting some good news this week. As reported in the press, DPC did receive a two-page letter from MSEB purporting to rescind the PPA with immediate effect because DPC materially misrepresented the capabilities of the power plant (i.e., 6 hour actual ramp-up time vs. 3 hour ramp-up schedule in the PPA). However, the letter goes on to state that MSEB is "agreeable to continue the present arrangement of power and payment until disputes are resolved by the appropriate forum." We are not entirely sure what this last part means and are asking MSEB for clarification. Obviously, this letter is quite a buttress to our already-delivered PTN contending that MSEB has evidenced an intention not to be bound by the PPA. While MSEB's letter seems to state that they will still honor some aspects of the PPA, the letter adds that "payments would be subject to adjustments on the basis of determination of reasonable compensation and quantum meruit by a competent authority." We hear rumors that MSEB will approach the Maharasthra Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC) for a "how much should we pay DPC" determination. If they do so and MERC accepts jurisdiction, this would help our expropriation, political force majeure and default arguments. DPC seems to have managed to avoid a construction contractor termination in May by agreeing to extend the required completion date for Block B by 9 days. While this action does not have long-term benefits to the project, I believe that it was a considerable sign of good faith that DPC is trying to give the lenders some time to assess whether they want to begin curing project agreement defaults on an ongoing basis.

Re: rylander job search	j-i've seen several articles recently re enron and india and have thought of you. in some ways it's hard to realize that one of us is involved in a matter of such great significance in the affairs of a major world power. what would jim roach think. i hope that all continues well with you and your family. it's hard, i know, when work and travel are so demanding; but as we have discussed on numerous occasions there is no substitute for family and friends. i've little to report in the way of any interesting reading recently; i've been spending time on books relating to bioethics and spanish literature[actually, il've taken a liking to spanish mysteries; although i've run out of our friend perez-reverte and am getting involved in some suggested by my spanish teacher]. deborah and i are immersing ourselves in a serious summer program of hiking and gardening and just enjoying our time together; it's a great feeling to have lived with someone for 30+ years and discover new and wonderful things. hopefully you'll find occasion to share a hike with us this summer. >	0

RE: Western Frontier update	I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today. They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work. I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003. I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity. However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity. Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d. I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d. Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely. If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest. Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years. Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.	0

FW: New E-Tag Feature: Potential Adjust List	I am pleased to announce that a new feature is being added to the E-Tag system: the Potential Adjust List (PAL). As you may or may not know, there is currently an "Adjust List" that is issued when TLRs are called. An "Adjust List" is a recommendation from the IDC that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve needed relief to eliminate a constraint. This Adjust List sent out to Generation and Load Control Areas and Tag Authors for all transactions that are being recommended for curtailment. It is intended to aid in coordination Control Area schedules during curtailment, as well as alert the marketplace of recommendations for their transactions to be curtailed. Under the current process, the Adjust List notice is sent out when the initiating Security Coordinator and all impacted Security Coordinators have agreed to recommend specific curtailments. As such, this recommendation can occur very late, leaving very little time for the market to react (i.e., resource and/or resink their power). The Potential Adjust List feature adds a second, earlier Adjust List that is sent out when the initiating SC requests relief, but prior to the confirmation of all the impacting SCs. This should allow this recommendation to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today, giving more time for the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks. When all impacted SCs confirm, the standard Adjust List recommendation is sent out as it is today. It should be recognized that both the Potential Adjust List and the standard Adjust List do not represent actual curtailments - in both cases, they are only recommendations for curtailment. Control Areas may elect to curtail different transactions or amounts than reflected in either Adjust List due to local relief procedures or other business practices. However, both lists should aid in mitigating risk associated with physical transactions and curtailments. Further, empirical evidence seems to indicate that in the majority of cases, the Potential Adjust List, standard Adjust List, and final curtailments will be very close. This change is based a proposal I wrote with the help and support of Jim Eckelkamp (Carolina Power and Light), Mark Scheel (Dynegy), and Patt Terris (Exelon Power Team). If you talk to any of them during the course of daily business, please thank them for their support of this effort. With their assistance in developing the concept, ironing out the technical details, and cultivating NERC support in the various forums, we were able to implement this change very quickly. I expect this change to take place sometime between June 15 and June 28. Attached, please find a message from NERC that describes the feature and how it works. If you would like more detail, please let me know. I currently Chair the group that is responsible for improving E-Tag, and as such, am intimately familiar with tagging and its functions. In the next few weeks, I will be working with Don Baughman and Juan Hernandez to ensure we utilize this feature (and others) to maximize the value of our E-Tagging tools. As indicated above, please feel free to contact me with any questions.	1
EGM Organization Update & Announcement	The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group. We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter. This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000. When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months. This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group. In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. Crude and Products group Mid-marketing Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group. Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well. The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services. This group reports to Randy Maffett. Origination In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope. Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan. Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide. The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets. Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. Trading Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South. The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland. Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas. Shipping Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products. Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line. Weather The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world. Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe. Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities. Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul. Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.

FW: Hello from UT	Hola, If all recipients would please be soooo kind as to respond back with a home mailing address....except for suebob and jojo..got your's already. Well, we I made it safely to UT. We made the drive in about 2 days getting to Provo the 2nd evening and Park City the following morning. Now I am reminded why they always say that it is much safer to fly than to drive cross country. The first day we NARROWLY avoided running out of gas in NOWHERE texas...and I also got a speeding warning from a state trooper. The 2nd day of driving across UT on a two-land highway from Moab to Provo was harsh...it was snowing..i had a deathgrip on the steering wheel while oncoming cars blinded me with their headlights and john slept. Those are just the bad parts but it was well worth the time hanging with John and seeing the country. I've met my 3 roomates, Jimmy, James & Thomas... and they seem normal and to John's delight none of them will be gracing a "Gorgeous Hunks of Park City Utah" calendar anytime soon. It has been snowing almost non-stop since I've been here...and it seems that everyone is off to ski or board here in town. I'm trying my best to hold off until the end of the week when all of my skiing and boarding activities will be free. I am scheduled to start this thurs at the bakery. I'm considering picking up another part time job just to keep things interesting, but I'm going to see how things go with a 40hr schedule first. I hope everyone is doing well. I just wanted to say hello and most importantly get everyones home address. So take care all and I'll be in touch. Sno-mo	0

RE: SoCalGas Response to TW Protest of AL 2837-A	Glen, I had a conversation with Pat Davidson (SoCal) yesterday. Things have been going smoothly, because SoCal has not been calling any OFO days. She felt like we would not have an issue until spring and at that time, there is an expectation that SoCal could be calling more OFOs. We agreed to continue talking, but that does not resolve the issue completely. Thanks.

The relevant language is on page 5 of their letter and has been highlighted for your convenience. In part, they state that: "These types of reductions are no different from today's practice of allowing customers to reduce nominations in the fourth scheduling cycle. The flaw is not in SoCalGas new procedures. SoCalGas provides customers with notice of an upcoming OFO two hours prior to scheduling cycle closing times. Within those two hours, customers can make changes to their nominations and still meet the scheduling timeline as defined by GISB standards. Even if SoCalGas cuts nominations in cycle four because customer reductions don't reduce deliveries enough to avoid operational problems, changes in cycle 4 are within GISB standards. Transwestern is supposed to be complying with those GISB standards and seems to state that it is unable to do so." They go on to state a willingness to work with us on the issue. There is no procedural option for us to respond to their response. At this point, our option is to meet with Energy Division staff to discuss the issue further, should we feel the need to do so.

Third Quarter Earnings Results	Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43. This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines. In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002. We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter. Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance. We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units. In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units. For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities. In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services. This quarter they are reported separately. Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately. Following are the highlights of our businesses: Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter. Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d). Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million. Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh). Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year. While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat. Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago. So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers. Transportation and Distribution: Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter. Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago. This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter. Last week, we announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural. This transaction is expected to close next year. Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind. Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year. Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year. This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs. Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago. In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion. Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core businesses. These charges include: ? A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ? $183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services. This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers. ? $544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement. With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things: 1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

We have resolved the BPA-James River contract	All, I am pleased to report that we have resolved the infamous James River contract with BPA under favorable terms. The signed agreements are on my desk right now. Besides significantly reducing our litigation risk, the addition of 7.5 MW/h and the change of delivery point have added $22.8 million to the value of the contract. BPA and EPMI have amended the original contract to specify that (i) BPA will deliver 102 MW/h 24/7 for the 5-year term of the agreement (an increase of 7.5 MW/h over the original), (ii) the disputed "alternative delivery point" is designated as Mid-C, (iii) all language to the contrary is deleted from the agreement, (iv) the parties agree to "book out" the James River physical deliveries against EPMI sales to BPA at the Mid-C delivery point (so no power will flow); and (v) we will continue to invoice BPA each month for the term of the agreement, just as if the power was still flowing. Although my preference would have been to terminate the James River agreement, BPA refused to do so because it would not have been able to recover the costs of this contract in its rates. Similarly, I had hoped that we could do a one-time book-out, but BPA refused to do so because--according to BPA's finance person---such a book-out would have converted this to a financial deal requiring BPA to use mark-to-market accounting. Therefore, we executed two documents: one amending the original contract, and another called the "Book-Out Agreement," which sets out an agreement to book-out specific transactions over the next five years. I am satisfied that this is a favorable deal for EPMI because (1) we resolve the disputes over quantity and delivery point, which (2) will make it very difficult for BPA to change its mind in the future and argue that we are not entitled to receive power unless we are selling it to James River, and (3) the negotiated increase in quantity and change in delivery point add over $22 million in value to the contract. Thanks to everyone for your help.	1

Organizational Announcement	From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly. In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future. We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market. To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business. We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO. In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer. Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron. We would like to thank Joe for his contributions. Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties.	2

Message Points on Current Status of Company	Message Points on Current Status of Company A. Our core businesses are strong, performing well and customers continue to demonstrate their confidence in us. B. EnronOnline experienced above average levels for number of transactions Wednesday (10/24/01), Enron recorded more than 8000 transactions with 1399 external users for a gross notional value of approximately $4 billion We continue to be the market maker of choice in wholesale gas and power C. Our gas and power numbers indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, nor reducing transaction levels with us. Indeed, customers are transacting at higher levels as they prepare their portfolios for the upcoming winter and protect themselves from price volatility.	1
Daily Update	Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating. We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations. The pipelines are not being sold. Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line. Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence. We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate. This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash. I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company. On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read: <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>. This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron. Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>). Thank you.	1

APEA Contracts	The FedEx package of contracts is going out tonight.

I am focused on making sure EOL and ENW do not pop up on your list of things to think about. Webb and Richter have been told that EOL up and performing well is critical. As you know, the trade counts looked good last week and Jay and Brad have been getting data to Louise on the specifics of certain counterparties, etc. I am having breakfast meetings with Directors and above in ENW all next week to listen to what they have been hearing and saying and to keep them informed, focused and motivated. My extension is 36635 and my cell is 713-646-4734. Thanks.	0
RE: Deal Bench and EnronOnline	I like this plan. Clearly it has organizational implications that will need to be addressed. Specifically, as I understand it, DealBench goes away. Most of the marketing folks can be directly deployed on marketing of EOL auctions, but we will have to find a home for some of the support staff. Also, we will have to redeploy some of the IT staff. Hopefully, we can find a way to do some of the integration/engineering effort of creating the EOL auctions engine in parallel with our other initiatives. I'll begin discussing that with Mike when you give me the go-ahead. --jay	2

But I agree that there should be lots of low-hanging fruit among the many users of derivatives for whom trading is not a core activity.	1
