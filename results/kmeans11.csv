IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE ENRON CORP SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS	PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions, involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed. As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC). Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans. On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.

New Stock Symbol	Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ." This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE. Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision. The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com. Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."	1
NOTICE TO: All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan	TO: All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system. As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account. This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded. This situation was identified and corrected. We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen. If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3. Corporate Benefits	1
Daily Update	Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating. We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations. The pipelines are not being sold. Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line. Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence. We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate. This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash. I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company. On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read: <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>. This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron. Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>). Thank you.	1
Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast	Dear Michael, Some of the star witnesses in the Enron collapse will appear Thursday at a hearing on Capitol Hill. The question remains: Will they have anything to say? The witness list includes former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Fastow is expected to invoke his constitutional privilege not to speak, but Skilling has indicated he'll talk. We'll have live reports covering the hearing from our Washington bureau on Thursday. Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge is expected to speak in front of the National Press Club on Thursday. We'll bring you all the details on Ridge's speech from the Washington bureau on Thursday. Tomorrow in Houston, the Ziff Energy Group is hosting the North American Gas Storage Conference.	0
Invitation to 436th Operations Group Change of Command	Family, With the recent tragedy, I am unsure when the following invitation will arrive to you via the US Mail. As many of you know, the US Mail is highly dependent upon our nation's airline system for the normal on-time delivery of cross country mail (normally within 3 to 4 days) which is mailed over approximately 600 miles. For the time being (and not sure when the prohibition will be lifted) the nation's passenger carrying domestic and international aircraft will not be allowed to fly mail or cargo in the cargo holds. This measure may go away soon or measures be made for increased x-ray, etc. However, this may result in delays of mail depending upon how much the trucking and rail industry can "absorb" in the cross country movement. The following invitations to the upcoming Change of Command were mailed on Tuesday, 12th Oct by the office of the Wing Commander of the 436th Airlift Wing (Dover Air Force Base, DE) who will be "my boss". I felt it best to send this e-mail just in case the invitation does not arrive for weeks. I hope you understand. As I reflect on the weeks ahead of taking command of the flying operations and port operations of this nation's largest military aerial port and strategic airlift wing we are humbled about the talents of the great many men and women of this operations group as they fly our nation's most precious and important cargoes to all faces of this world through times of peace, contingency and if need be war. Content of the Invitation follows: Kenny and Jan ------------------- TO: Each of you and family Colonel Scott E. Wuesthoff Commander, 436th Airlift Wing requests the pleasure of your company at the passing of the colors and command of the 436th Operations Group from Colonel Mark S. Solo to Colonel Kenneth R.

Increased Security at Enron Center	Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center. We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit. Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further. Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.	2
Solicitation Calls	Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters. In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?" If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department. Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group. And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential. Thank you.	0
Kristin Walsh- Questions for You	Michelle, Kristin Walsh, a manager in Competitive Analysis, is returning from maternity leave on October 15th. During Kristin's absence, the following changes have occurred in the group, and I just wanted to run them by you before we communicate them to her: 1) Kristin will only have two direct reports instead of three. 2) Previously, Kristin's team as a whole was responsible for providing ENA (i.e. John and Louise, as well as traders) with competitive intelligence. Instead of Kristen just overseeing the ENA process as a whole, Kristin and her two team members will have more specific duties, although Kristin will still be the primary point of contact for ENA. Specifically, Kristin will gather and provide intelligence info for the Gas Team, and Kelly Holman will gather and provide info for East Power, and Greg Whitman will do the same for West Power. Robert Johnston, Kristin's supervisor, and Scott Tholan, BUL, just felt like the level of service that Kristin's team was providing was not adequate because efforts were duplicated and Kristin could not provide enough "face time" with the head traders to gather and relay info, as well as directing her team. Also,after Kristin's departure, it was learned that Kristen signed a contract for which she had no authority. Although Scott does not think that this has happened before, this particular contract blew up in their face. Upon Kristin's return, Scottt, Robert, and I would like to communicate these changes to her (not in writing, just verbally), and just reitterate the fact that only Scott has the authority to sign contracts. Additionally, we would like to tell Kristin that she needs to take a management training class so that she can learn to delegate and oversee responsibilities of the group, rather than micromanaging them. Please let me know if this is going to create any additional problems, or if I need to take a different approach. As always, thanks for your help. Anne	0
Dr. Mo's notice period	Michelle, All efforts to try to get Mo to reduce his contract pay and end the separation negotiations have been unsuccessful and on August 9th, he sent me an e-mail stating that he has decided to continue his garden leave with full pay & benefits and will await "Enron's notification regarding termination according to his employment terms." We were prepared that he would come back with this and we will continue to pay him, but it's this last statement about the notification of termination that concerns me. I would have thought that our presentation of a separation agreement to him back in November would have been enough written "notification" that we do not wish to continue his employment past the contract end date, but in speaking with him further, he seems to think that its not. His contract states that if the Company terminates your employment without 12 months written notice, then the Company shall pay you the remainder of your salary for the 12 months from the date it gave your notice, in a lump sum. His contract end date is 6/30/2002 and the last thing we want to do is to pay him additional money. Please let me know what your legal interpretation of this notification clause is and whether or not we are required to give him a formal termination notice. Thanks Cathy	1
CONFIDENTIAL Personnel issue	Michelle/Lizsette; I was wondering if circumstances with Jonathan Lane (the contract Help desk person whom I mentioned to you a week or so ago) have been resolved? When we last spoke I mentioned that he went to Valeria Hope's group. I am not sure of the outcome of that visit, but I will tell you that his negative attitude and general dissatisfaction on the team is becoming disruptive to the other help desk members. He is away from his desk often (having "meetings", which may be interviews for other positions), he has shared with the other team members his perceptions of management and his issues with us. If and when I can do so, I would like to terminate him. I won't until I hear from you all, and we are documenting discussions as you requested. I hope this can end soon, though because this is causing real problems here. Gina	0
Papiers Stadacona Employee Communication	Michelle: Thanks for taking a look at this memo that Andre Sarasin of Papiers Stadacona would like to send out to his employees today. Please note that this will be issued in French, so this English translation is not perfect...but it least it gets the main message across. Please let me know what you think--both Peter and Cheryl have approved this. Thanks, Jennifer x3-9964 The management of Papiers Stadacona met yesterday and this morning the union representatives as well as the staff personnel to answer their questions concerning Papiers Stadacona's situation and its owner's. Mr. Sarasin repeated that the activities of Papers Stadacona are profitable and he has the conviction that it is in the interest of all parties concerned to continue the operations of Papers Stadacona and the Quebec Mill. In several circumstances during the last quarter of century, the different owners of our company have had financial difficulties and, in every case, the Quebec Mill continued to operate for the simple reason that it is profitable. Mr. Sarasin believes that the present situation is no exception to the rule. On the other hand, concerning questionings on the pension plan of employees, we are to be reminded that these funds are completely independent from the Company. Indeed, these are placed in trust with the Royal Trust and no creditor can have access to these funds. The current situation can evolve quickly, but whatever is the result, our strategy is to fill our obligations, i.e. to make papers and board of quality, to control our costs and to continue to improve our productivity and the efficiency of our mill.	0
FW: STRANGE CALL	I received a suspicious phone call from Kathy Delano at Portland General who was asking for the names of the employees who were still reporting to me. Kathy said that she works for Arlene Barnett (VP HR), who wants to send all of us a 25 page document. Without providing them any information, I took down their names and checked the Enron phone book. I verified that the names are Portland General HR representatives; however, I am not sure why Portland General HR would be wanting to send something to us. The number Kathy provided was (503) 464 - 8000 - which appears to be the main Portland General switch board. Maybe I am being a bit too paranoid - however - can you follow up on this.	0
Daily Update	Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued. Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering. The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation. However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company. I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.	1
PPW THIS WEEK	Dear Team, The electronic copy of this week's PPW has not been published at this time. I will keep you posted as soon as it is available. Thanks.	1
Norske Downtime for 1Q02	NorskeCanada announced today plans for additional curtailment for the first quarter of 2002 at its B.C. paper operations, as weak economic conditions have reduced demand for the company's products. Norske is planning to shutdown 2 paper machines until market conditions improve. No. 3 paper machine at Port Alberni and No. 1 paper machine at Elk Falls are currently scheduled for shutdown in the 1Q02. A third paper machine, No. 1 at Crofton, is also planned for shutdown during the month of January. This translates into about 34,000 MT for 1Q02 at Elk Falls (since Port Alberni produces mostly directory) and about 12,000 MT at the Crofton mill for January. Given the uncertain economic climate, the company will review curtailment plans monthly so it can be quick to respond to any upturn in market conditions. Please find the Downtime database for 2002 attached below.	0

Management Changes	With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company. The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild. First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process. This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business. The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer. Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations. Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy. As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization. In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg. We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward. In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive. I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer. We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined. Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday. The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead. And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees. Link to the press release: http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/012902Release.html	0
Organizational Announcement	As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently. Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee. This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees. The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11. Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections. Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain. From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun. Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed. We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future. Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week. This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company. By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business. Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership. We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO. It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO. The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder. We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January. As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention. This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee. We will update you periodically on our process. Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization. Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley. Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee. Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently. In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp. Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis. Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development. In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation. Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon. Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM. As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan. Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December: Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO. We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling. Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term. We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process. We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.	0

Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.

Enron Update	Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3. We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit. This is still above investment grade. The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB. In S&P's words, "Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company." S&P also said, "[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales." As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses. It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns. In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity. We will continue to update you as new developments arise. Thank you.	0
Recruiting and Floor Buildout	During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we= are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor buil= d out given the state of the company today. We appreciate people's concern= s about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be redu= cing unnecessary expenses. Let us begin by saying that we share these conc= erns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditu= res without a great deal of thought. We would also encourage people to tal= k to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing= certain things. In short, we have decided to continue with the college re= cruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire. = We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple= of weeks. Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting? During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a p= resence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading= schools in the northwest. This past year we finally reached critical mass= and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts. Although we are unc= ertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best lon= g term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the north= west. We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at mo= st schools. We have identified the best people from each school and have a= lready made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays. = The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit = that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as pa= rticipants in their on-campus recruiting programs. We also realize that it= is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job. It is our be= lief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities= of employment may be somewhat diminished. Finally, we would like to empha= size the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody. We will i= nterview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions ba= sed on the needs of the office. Before extending offers we will consider t= he potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron e= mployees in other offices who have been redeployed. Stated another way, we= don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enro= n who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people alread= y here at risk. We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are mor= e certain about the state of affairs in the company. How Will the Floor Move Play Out? We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks. While we = still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause fo= r a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money o= n this. When talking to the build out team today it became clear that dela= ying would accomplish several goals. First, it allows us to get final arch= itectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can mo= re precisely peg down the costs before moving forward. Second, it gives th= e build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move= . Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes= sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right n= ow. While we still think that we are going to move forward with this proje= ct, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do= right now. In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team w= ith firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, o= r delay again. =20 As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, rel= iable information becomes available. We recognize that this is a very hard= time for everyone. Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep= up the success of this office.	0
Solicitation Calls	Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters. In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?" If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department. Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group. And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential. Thank you.	0
Anthrax and other Biological Agent Threats	We understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees. Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances. Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms. We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures. If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com. The most important thing to remember is: Do not panic. To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist. Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics. Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another. Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages: What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel? (Remember, these are only guidelines. Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious.) -- It is marked with the word "Anthrax." -- It has a non-identifiable powdery substance on the outside. -- It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you. -- Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated. -- Has no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate. -- Is of unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped. -- Has an unusual amount of tape on it. -- Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as "personal" or "confidential". -- Has a strange odor or stain. -- Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address. What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax? -- Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package. -- Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents. -- If you do not have any container, then cover the envelope or package with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover. -- Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). -- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face. -- Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor. Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities. -- List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for follow-up investigations and advice. If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out: -- Do not try to clean up the powder. Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover! -- Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). -- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face. Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor. Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities. -- Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed. This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling. -- Shower with soap and water as soon as possible.

FW: Newest ASAP from Littler Mendelson	Below is the response from our broker commenting on the coverage issue posed by NEPCO. Our confidential approach to this policy is in jeopardy as more and more people are creating a need to know and the "traffic" on this topic (internally and externally) has increase considerably. On this Nepco inquiry, I suggest that I speak with David Lund on the coverage and request that he keep same confidential and advise his operations people that they need not pursue the issue any further. Please advise if you concur? On this same subject, I have received a request from Michelle Cash to notify our insurers of a potential "age discrimination " claim. EEOC has made an "inquiry", which means (according to Michelle), that they have received a complaint and want information. I have discussed with our broker, and they recommend, based upon review of the reporting provisions in the policy, that we file a report of a potential claim with underwriters. I do not have the all facts nor do I have copies of any of any documents, however, understand that this arises from the "Performance Review process". This is one we should discuss, as it could involve a large class of people. Please give me a call. -----Original Message----- From: Paul Sparks <pspa@mcgriff.com>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Paul+20Sparks+20+3Cpspa+40mcgriff+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com] Sent: Monday, April 30, 2001 5:44 AM To: Bouillion, James L.; Mary Harkins Cc: Alastair Muir-Taylor; Paul Sparks; Kendall, Earline; Natalie Solomon Subject: RE: Newest ASAP from Littler Mendelson Jim, Your coverage, with AEGIS, does extend to the individual employees should they be named as a defendant in employment related litigation.

We need to check out with Enron Insurance group to determine if our current employment practice liability insurance covers a situation like this. The distinction is that if the plaintiff employee names the company, we're covered, but he/she names only the supervisor "personally" would the Enron insurance decline coverage?

Our ASAP's are our summaries of recent developments in employment matters. This ASAP addresses a recent case from the Washington State Supreme Court in which that court held that individual supervisors can be held personally liable for acts of unlawful harassment and discrimination. This ruling relates to the Washington state discrimination statute and not Title VII. This ruling is contrary to federal law under Title VII where individual supervisors are not personally liable for such acts. Similarly, individual supervisors are not subject to personal liability under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act. It may be prudent for employers with workers in Washington to review insurance and indemnity agreements to determine if these contracts cover supervisors who may be sued for acts in the course and scope of their employment. http://www.littler.com/nwsltr/asap_scott_paper.html <http://www.littler.com/nwsltr/asap_scott_paper.html> Please double click on the above link to access the ASAP.

FW: EBS Belgium - y/e 31.12.00	Jim: Please see the attached. This was my attempt to get a more appropriate signatory to some of these financial statements that you have been inundated with. With respect to EBS Belgium, as a practical matter I don't think we can expect to get employees who are no longer with the Company (Ken Rice, Steve Elliott) to sign; indeed, I will try to find out why they are still on the list. We'll keep trying to find other, more appropriate folks to address these matters, but my guess is that you will continue to receive some of these for awhile. Rex	0
Program Changes	As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history. We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition. It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ? ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program. The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders. Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored. Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service. Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ? Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely. As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations. Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored. We regret that we have had to make these changes. We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.	1
Decommission Wireless Hubs	Due to recent concerns about the lack of security over wireless networks, all wireless hubs will be disconnected from the Enron network on Tuesday, 3/26.

Notice to Employees of Bankruptcy Court Order	This is to inform you that on January 25, 2002 the Honorable Arthur Gonzalez, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered an order as follows: It is hereby Ordered that until further Order of this Court, Enron Corp., its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered chapter 11 proceedings (collectively "Enron"), and Enron's employees shall preserve, and refrain from destroying or disposing of, any of Enron's records, either in electronic or paper form. Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences. We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully. Thank you.	0
Management Changes	With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company. The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild. First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process. This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business. The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer. Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations. Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy. As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization. In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg. We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward. In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive. I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer. We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined. Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday. The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead. And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees. Link to the press release: http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/012902Release.html	0

FROM RAYMOND BOWEN, JR., Exec. V.P., FINANCE & TREASURER	To: All Enron Employees From: Raymond Bowen, Jr. EVP, Finance & Treasurer Subject: Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement Post-Petition Expenses Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal. Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission. Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors. New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming. In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses. All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation. Pre-Petition Expenses We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000. We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses. This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel. We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses. We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000. Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap. Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through. Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com. Thank you for your patience.	0
Media Reports	As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston. It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities. Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time. However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation. We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe. If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804. If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670. At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs. Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.	0
-	Carl: I was recently informed via Janet Bowers at NNG that there have been some issues with regard to the gas contract to serve the Pleasant Valley Peaker. In order to have someone address your issues, I have passed on your concerns to Darron Giron who works Mid-Market and Origination on the Central Gas Desk. Darron's number is 713-853-9573. I have also made the VP of the Central Gas Desk aware of your concerns. You should be getting a call from Darron in the next couple of days after he has had a chance to get up to speed on the transaction. I am now doing long term power marketing in the ECAR region and thought it was best to let the gas desk address this; however, please feel free to contact me should the situation warrant. Thanks	1
Solicitation Calls	Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.

HireSynergy's contribution to Enron's employees	Attention: All Enron Employees HireSynergy wants to express its condolences for everyone at Enron.

Daily Update	Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued. Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering. The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation. However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company. I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.	1
cost analysis update	Mike, Since the IT guys want to wait for the new software to put your cost analysis on the plasma screens I am currently working on using Reuters so that we'll have something in the meantime. I had to call Lori Hernandez, Reuters contact, and have her add some more products to Kobra. As soon as she gets back to me I'll put that together and get it on the screens. Let me know if you have other questions. Aaron	1
Pipeline Cutoffs	Just an update, to keep everyone current on the progress of this initiative: We (Matt (from Unify), Liz, Dave, and myself) met today and attempted to find ways to directly relate the Passport information (from El Paso) to the corresponding prices etc. in Unify. Unfortunately, we discovered that there is no direct "fool-proof" way to accomplish this. However, we have come up with a couple of things to try: Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other information they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifies each deal / cut. Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating the data to Unify much easier. Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the "scheduled quantity" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub. It's possible that this file contains cut information itself, which would possibly alleviate the need to use the Passport file altogether. I believe that succinctly recaps the results of our meeting today. If I have misrepresented anything, please let me know. Also, feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns. Thanks, Chris	1
RE: Denver	I agree that we should not move the business at this time, but we do need cross-training to occur. Eventually the business should come here to Houston. The decision was made to bring the physical trading business to the Houston office and I do not believe that that task has been completed. My feelings are for continuity that all operations involving trading and scheduling of physical gas should move here under your firm control and direction. I also think that some of our counterparties are confused as to who to call concerning these types of deals and that trading decisions are being made in Denver without our knowledge until after the fact. This is something that I have heard from you and Barry that should not be happening. I would still like to go to Denver for the cross-training to occur and we can determine the eventual placement of these operations after things calm down. Jay -----Original Message----- From: Grigsby, Mike Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 2:36 PM To: Reitmeyer, Jay Subject: Denver In light of the current circumstances with the company and the concerns that our counterparties have at this time, I would like to leave the upstream business in Denver.

Richardson Products Non-payment of Invoices	FYI - In case you have not yet heard... Richardson Products has not paid their $1,661,000 TW line pack sales invoice. They are claiming to have a Global Netting Agreement with Enron and are netting this payment with ENA and EGL issues. We asked for a copy of this agreement even though we are certain that TW is not a party to it. Paul Cherry, TK, Steve Kleb and I are all following up with our counterparts and are giving the collection of this money top priority. We will keep you informed. Rick	0
RE: Richardson Products Non-payment of Invoices	FYI - The current status is that TW faxed Richardson Products a letter from our Credit department informing them they no longer satisfy the creditworthiness standards in the tariff and need to provide security of at least $1.7 million dollars by Thursday, January 3rd to avoid suspension of services. Paul Cherry's counterpart, Herb Truelove, called back to say that TW should not combine the gas sales with their firm transportation contracts and they should only provide security for their $130 thousand dollars worth of firm transportation. We countered that regardless of whether the exposure is from transportation services, storage, imbalances work orders or gas sales, we include all potential exposure when enforcing our global credit policy. If they do not pay by January 3rd, we will force them into prepayment status and discuss not accepting their nominations. Paul, Kim, TK and I are all working this issue hard and I believe we have it under control. Rick	1

Enron Blood Drive	Due to the overwhelming response from Enron employees and contractors, today's blood drive appointments are completely full, and there are a large number of you who still wish to donate blood. We are working diligently with the M. D. Anderson Blood Bank to schedule another day for blood donations, and you will be notified as soon as that date is secured. For those of you who are interested in giving, please continue to either call the Enron Health Center, ext. 3-6100, to get your name on the waiting list or go to the donation line in front of the building. We recognize and are grateful to the many of you who are wanting to give blood today, but ask that you be patient and understand our inability to accept walk-in donations at this time. Thanks again for the tremendous outpouring of concern.	1
SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE	As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel. Updates will be posted as necessary under "bulletins" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com. We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities. As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities. We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice. Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions. In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings. We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable. Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com. U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan. Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities. All travel to or through these countries should be canceled. Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport. If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures. Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements. You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.	1
Outlook Communication	Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our em= ail environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for= Outlook users. The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w= e have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues.=20 ?=09During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exc= hange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients. This bug,= which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the be= tter part of a day. At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which ap= pears to have resolved the problem. We have carefully monitored the Exchan= ge servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug. ?=09Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experience= d database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Ou= tlook users. To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchan= ge servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected serv= er. We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --= we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit= h the server. While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus= iness week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on W= ednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to mov= e users to different servers. During these evenings and weekend, the impac= ted users could not access their e-mail. ?=09During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and danger= ous viruses on the internet. We have a multi-layered defense against virus= es that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops. All mail = is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop= s. During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning= updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day. = The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance= of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus = product rescans every message in every mailbox. This is unfortunate, but w= e believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron co= mputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems. At this t= ime, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that = will speed up the virus scanning process. We have made some progress as th= e performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to = get better. There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las= t few weeks are unacceptable. We are continuing to monitor and improve the= overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and= meet Enron's business needs and expectations. Enron Global Technology	1
Increased Security at Enron Center	Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center. We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit. Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further. Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.	2
NERC security update from DOE	A quote from Pennsylvania Ave.: "This is pretty serious!" This was just received from the DOE and pertains particularly to DOE and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) facilities: "DOE/NNSA is at SECON 3 with additional measures designed to detect and deter vehicular-borne explosives. Effective immediately, and until further notice, all DOE/NNSA activities shall add measures to their current heightened state of readiness designed to deter terrorist attacks by visibly increased perimeter security and security checks. Change in routines, including institution of random measures, shall also be implemented." Thank you,	1
Enpower problem	For the last two nights, the hourly desk night crew was unable to view/print the scheduling activity report (SAR) for the northeast hourly book. This report provides detail as to whether or not the book is flat net megawatts for the day. We were able to view and print the SAR report for the remaining hourly books (ERCOT, southeast, midwest). Why is this problem persisting? Please investigate this to rectify this situation. Thanks.	0
MDEA May 4 HE5 4 Mwhs	Guys, Rebecca Grace received a call from Axia and they are NOT agreeing that they sold us 4 Mwhs for HE5 on May 4. The MDEA 0504.xls model (maintained at the time by GENCO) indicates that we made a 4 Mwh purchase from Axia for MDEA. Rebecca has checked OATI for any/all tags for this day and has accounted for everything but that transaction. I was hoping we could find out who was working that morning and perhaps they could check their records / log book to see if the transaction occured and verify it was, in fact, AXIA. Please let me know and copy Rebecca Grace what we can do to resolve this issue.	1
SAP SECURITY MAILBOX OUTAGE	We are having a technical problem with the SAP Security email box. Please DO NOT forward any security requests to this box until further notice.

Dynegy complaint against SPP (EL01-104)	On July 17 , 2001, Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. filed a complaint against the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. Dynegy alleges that the SPP has violated its OATT by unreasonably restricting Point-to-Point Transmission Services customers' right to change of receipt and delivery points on a firm basis. Specifically, Dynegy complains that SPP unfairly limits changes of receipt and delivery points to those that permanently redirect the reservation (i.e., for the balance of the reservation term). Dynegy documents several specific instances in which its redirect requests were automatically denied. I will keep you updated on this proceeding; if you would like more details on the complaint in the meantime, please let me know.	0

Solicitation Calls	Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters. In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?" If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department. Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group. And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential. Thank you.	0
FW: Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today	FYI>>>We were also monitoring the EOL to Sitara bridge during this time to inform our traders and other desks of the situation and status...All deals bridged over by 10:30ish. THANKS -----Original Message----- From: Truong, Dat Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2001 11:11 AM To: Moorer, Torrey; Lamadrid, Victor; Severson, Russ; Grant, George Cc: Husain, Karima; Lim, Francis S.; Saluja, Gurdip; Sweitzer, Tara Subject: Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate. Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup). Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue. The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate. -Dat Truong	0

MISO Registration	The last I heard, the MISO is supposed to begin offering service on their OASIS tomorrow for service starting January 1. I wanted to let all of you know a bit about where we stand with regards to that process. I have been working with several different folks here and at the MISO to ensure that we are ready to do business with the MISO and request service. The MISO OASIS seems to be accepting our Tradewave Certs, so we just need to get our MISO login for their systems. Today, the MISO will be sending out logins to their systems via FedEx, and should arrive prior to 10am. Christi Nicolay will be receiving this information and distributing it as soon as it arrives. Unfortunately, the MISO has been (as you probably know) cutting things closer and closer to the edge. This login was supposed to be delivered a couple weeks ago, but they have just gotten around to sending it out. Hopefully, we will not have any problems with it once it arrives. As I understand it, there should be only one login set up for "EPMI 24-Hour Operations," with a login of "Enron." The password is currently only known by the MISO, but should be contained in the letter we receive tomorrow. This login is a temporary one until we complete our final registration. This final registration has been a bit more of a pain, as it has involved contractual agreements and credit obligations. I am still working with our Legal, Credit, and AP folks to get everything set up. Again, the MISO sent the final documents out fairly recently, and we have not had a great amount of time to review, analyze, and negotiate their terms. Hopefully, we will have come to agreement with MISO about those items, and be able to file that final application soon. If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at my desk (X53771) or via my cellular (713-927-4680). Obviously, you can also call Christi (X37007) or Susan Lindberg (X30596) as well.	1
FUNDIES MEETING EVERY DAY BEGINNING NEXT WEEK	For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy. We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market. Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report. I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning. Grigsby	0
RE: Testing - Fin Gas spreads	I apologize for not getting back with you all last week. We ran a few transactions on the spread product with the Auto Hedge function, but no hedge transaction was booked. Unfortunately, this function is not available on the spread product itself. I will let you know if/when a solution is available to accomodate this request. It has been brought to our attention before. The only immediate solution would be to manually change the risk book, but I know you guys do not want to go that route. I'll be in touch. Chris	1
CAFC Ruling on 2003 Prozac Patent	We learned today that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has modified its opinion of August 9, 2000 in which it found the 2003 Prozac patent invalid for double patenting. In essence, the Court has again ruled that the patent is invalid for double patenting, but has used a different analysis to reach this conclusion. We intend to seek legal review of today's decision. Although it is possible that the legal review process could delay Barr from entering the market on August 3, we continue to plan for Barr launching generic fluoxetine at that time. On a related note, in our current litigation with Zenith/Reddy-Cheminor, Zenith used the prior Barr decision to allege that the olanzapine patent was invalid for double patenting. The reversal of the August 9 decision removes that argument from Zenith's presentation of its case. Attached to this message are copies of press releases issued by Lilly and Barr regarding the CAFC's decision. Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions in this regard.

Going Forward	I can only imagine the extreme pressure and stress you are under right now. I just want to say that we have every confidence in you and the management team you are forming. WE will get through this, just as our country will get through the international situation. Everyone needs a word of encouragement every now and then; I wanted to say we are behind you, respect you and your leadership. We are trying to do our part in staying focused on our responsibilities, and in some small way contribute to correcting Enron's reversal of fortunes. Thanks, Ken, for your dedication and inspiration.	0

Hang in There	Ken, I realize these are tough days for you. I want you to know that I am glad you are there and that you are the key to getting things back on track. I am certain that you have seen tough times before (unlike much of your management) and that you will LEAD Enron through this period. From a bystander position (I left Enron in May), I encourage you to clearly bring all the issues to light immediately, take the lumps, and demonstrate to the community and the employees that necessary corrections will be made and made competently and forcibly. Times like these define leaders and I know you have the courage and experience to hang in there. If there is anything I can do to assist, let me know.	0

Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages	The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide. Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages. We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures. However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again. To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.	1
TCO update	Brad, I got a better picture of the delay issue when I talked to Keith this morning. Apparently, his group has lost their server liscence. As a consequence they cannot access their materials. Keith is doing everything he can that does not require the server, and when they regain access, we will get the map out asap. In the mean time, I am looking into major interconnects as well as storage facilities. As of now, I don't have a precise timeline on when the server issue will be resolved. When it occurs, I'll let you know. Thanks Adam	1
Update on TCO map	Brad, I talked with Keith friday afternoon about the TCO map. After 1:00pm friday, their server went down, and they couldn't access any of the files or save the changes to the Map. He told me that if all goes well Monday morning, we can see a map a little after noon. I will work with him Monday morning to make sure I can have it for you asap. Right now the map includes current day and yesterday's information for the relevant market delivery zones. During next week, I will add interconnects to the map as well a storage fields to present a complete picture. Thanks, Adam	1

Management Changes	To: Enron Employees From: Office of the Chief Executive Date: February 21, 2002 Re: Management Changes As a company working to emerge from bankruptcy, Enron looks and feels completely different. However, one thing is the same - we continue to move and change at a fast pace. Last week, we shared with you a developing management team. This week, we want to update you on some further management changes that have taken shape. Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel, will retire from Enron effective March 1, 2002. Rob Walls, currently deputy general counsel, will succeed Derrick and serve immediately as acting general counsel.

We will continue to share changes to the management team as they occur.	0
Organizational Announcement	As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce. We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base. Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron. We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman. David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function. The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.

Security Update	Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world. Som= e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne= l) and some are phasing in. While not all of the changes will be visible, = there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities. In all th= e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti= es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi= ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business. Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con= trols organization. You can contact this organization through their websit= e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email = (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>). John B= rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization. Pleas= e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, = or to report security threats. We have two areas to update you on: changes in the access procedures for t= he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory. Access to the Enron Center Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins= tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical): ?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron = Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer. ?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid = picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S= . or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif= ication).=20 ?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing= in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca= rd. Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o= r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica= tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center. ?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b= adged contractor at all times. ?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo= yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio= n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm= ent. At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to= the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected= , and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the = escorting employee or badged contractor. ?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their = workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu= rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y= ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others. These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit= uted at Enron. We ask that all employees be patient during congested times= in the lobby. As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi= pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease. We hope you understand the= se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09 Travel Advisory Update With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda= tions: ?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend= s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided. We continue to str= ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak= istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo= rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled. In addition, we recommend that = planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara= bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered. ?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit= y recommends that you carry documentation. There have been several recent = reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question= ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re= sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni= ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th= eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.

It appears that Immi= gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National= ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi= stration" documentation with them at all times.

Enron Update	This has been a tough couple of weeks. I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company. Here's a rundown of events from last week: We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion. Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets. We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity. Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas. - The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties. The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry. As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us. Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2. Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB. Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-. All agency ratings are investment grade. Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that: EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday. Transaction counts remain higher than average. EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas. EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi. EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities. Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question. We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole. We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company. And that's where you come in. Look around you. Look at the excellence that you and your team represents. That's the reason we hired you - you're the best. Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other. Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.	0
Daily Update	Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued. Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering. The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation. However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company. I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.	1
Holiday Party - Canceled	I know that this is a difficult time for all of us. With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year. To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed. Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season. Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances. After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8. Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event. I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more. We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.	0
Increased Security at Enron Center	Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center. We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit. Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further. Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.	2
Dynegy v. ComEd update	Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today. ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement. Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an "icap/capacity" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states "ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.) We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.	1
DRAFT: INFORMATION, Please Read: UBSWE Migration postponed	Due to a variety of circumstances we did not migrate employees to the UBSWE environment tonight (Monday, February 4, 2002).

Notice to Employees of Bankruptcy Court Order	This is to inform you that on January 25, 2002 the Honorable Arthur Gonzalez, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered an order as follows: It is hereby Ordered that until further Order of this Court, Enron Corp., its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered chapter 11 proceedings (collectively "Enron"), and Enron's employees shall preserve, and refrain from destroying or disposing of, any of Enron's records, either in electronic or paper form.

Parking - ACTION REQUIRED	For the past several weeks, we have been working diligently to receive the parking subsidy from Houston. However, due to the bankruptcy filing Enron has not been able to process checks. For the month of December, you will be personally responsible for your parking. This includes all parking lots (Lot 108, Lot 303, the WTC parking garage) and any parking validations. If you have been parking in Lot 108, Lot 303 or Lot 2WTC, your responsibility begins 12/1/01. For those parking in other lots, we will be unable to reimburse employees for the month of December. For those who have a payroll parking deduction, we will stop the deduction on the 12/31/01 pay period. Grace and I are working on a resolution plan for the monies that were deducted incorrectly, so please be patient as we work through the various issues. It has not been determined whether Enron will continue to subsidize parking but you will be notified as soon as we receive information from Corporate. We sincerely apologize for the insufficient notice and the inconvenience that this may have caused. Again, thank you for the patience. We are all trying to do our best in a difficult situation!	0

Update on Credit Card Use and Company Expenses	Our Director of Corporate Travel has informed us that American Express will not be able to establish a new Corporate account for us at this time. Until we are able to obtain company-sponsored credit cards, when incurring company expenses it will be necessary to use personal credit cards or cash, which can then be submitted for reimbursement through the expense report system. You may want to refrain from incurring any reimbursable expenses until we receive further assurances from the company that they have the processes in place to pay them. As information becomes available about administrative operations, I will relay it to you. Please contact me if you have any questions.	1
Foreign Insolvency Procedures	IF YOU ARE A DIRECTOR OR OFFICER OF A NON-US CORPORATION WITHIN THE ENRON GROUP, PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING: As you are aware, Enron Corp. and some of Enron's subsidiaries have voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 earlier this week. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of the filing on the company in which you serve as a director or officer. It is possible that the filing may trigger default or cross default provisions under contracts and other instruments to which your company is a party or otherwise subordinated. With that respect, we request that you DO NOT TAKE ANY STEPS TO FILE FOR ANY LOCAL INSOLVENCY PROCEDURE UNTIL YOU HAVE NOTIFIED THE ENRON IN-HOUSE ATTORNEY WITH WHOM YOU NORMALLY WORK AND ALSO HAVE SPOKEN TO CHRIS MALLON (christopher.mallon@weil.com) OR MARGARITA COALE (margarita.coale@weil.com)OR RAM BURSHTINE (ram.burshtine@weil.com) AT WEIL, GOTSHAL & MANGES LLP,PHONE NUMBER: +713 546 5000).	0

UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week	Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today. We want to encourage you to come to work. We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options. Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process. I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy. But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee. I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices. Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority. We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue. Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination. I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you. I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so. While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them. We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search. We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni. We will share more information on these efforts soon. I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.	0

Enron Updates	Here is an update of some recent Enron developments. Enron Europe Closes Certain Operations Following Enron's credit rating downgrade yesterday and the impact that had on Enron Europe's ability to trade, Enron Europe has asked a court to appoint an Administrator. What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions. This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex. It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland. Efforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible. There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term. This action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees. Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved. Enron Appoints New Board Member Yesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors. Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits. He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters. Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies. Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee. Enron Evaluates Dividends Today Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.

Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages	The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide. Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages. We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures. However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again. To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.	1
Organizational Announcement	As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce. We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base. Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron. We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman. David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function. The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman. Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.

Crescendo	After meeting with Jesus Melendrez this morning, meeting with the Crescendo folks for a few minutes this afternoon (they were in the office in connection with other matters) and talking with the Crescendo lawyer on the phone, I called Chris Sullivan to let him know that his letter to Jim Derrick had been referred to me for handling. I started my conversation with Mr. Sullivan by telling him that I had no substantive knowledge about this matter and that I had talked with the Crescendo folks briefly about his letter and expected that they would respond to the substantive points he raised "sooner rather than later". Mr. Sullivan was not thrilled with this response indicating that he already knew what Crescendo had to say on the subject. In fact, this was an interesting comment since, at other times during our call, he mentioned that he had been waiting for a reply from Crescendo for months. He then went on for some time about how he had been talking to Crescendo and others about his helium rights for up to 2 years (his time estimates changed as he continued to talk) and that he believed the project was scheduled to go on line in early November and still had not received a satisfactory response from Crescendo. He also mentioned a call to Keith Pruitt at Enron in February and that he hadn't heard back from him either. It sounded to me like Mr. Sullivan wanted Enron to support his position and intervene on his behalf against Crescendo based only on his letter. In any event, Mr. Sullivan again threatened to involve the government and go forward with litigation to prevent helium from being wasted. I reiterated that I could not discuss his substantive concerns, that I was not yet up to speed on this matter and that we would look into it. I received from Jesus copies of the correspondence between Crescendo and Mr. Sullivan as well as a legal opinion on Crescendo's obligations, if any, to Mr. Sullivan. Also included in the information I received were copies of the letters exchanged between Crescendo and the BLM on this matter. I am in the process of reviewing these and expect to talk to Crescendo's attorney this weekend. In the meantime, he is working on a response to the substantive points raised in Sullivan's letter. Please call with any questions or comments.	0

Work Hours	Dear West, We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron. If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day. Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons. We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market. We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day. Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself. Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.	0
Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation	As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships. Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation. Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice. Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions. You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions. You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously. In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel. If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.	0
Solicitation Calls	Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.

New Stock Symbol	Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ." This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE. Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision. The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com. Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."	1
Flexible Spending Accounts	Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts. Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays. Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records. Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue. Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims. Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4. Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.	0

Program Changes	As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history. We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition. It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ? ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program. The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders. Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored. Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service. Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ? Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely. As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations. Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored. We regret that we have had to make these changes. We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.	1

UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week	Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today. We want to encourage you to come to work. We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options. Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process. I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy. But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee. I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices. Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority. We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue. Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination. I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you. I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so. While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them. We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search. We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni. We will share more information on these efforts soon. I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation. Ken	0

Management Changes	With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company. The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild. First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process. This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business. The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer. Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations. Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy. As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization. In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg. We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward. In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive. I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer. We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined. Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday. The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead. And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees. Link to the press release: http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/012902Release.html	0

Employee Meeting Postponed	We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future. Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner. While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that. We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency. However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it. We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy. We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized. Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure. You can expect that memo shortly.	0

Bankruptcy Management Committee	In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.

It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors. Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.	0
Solicitation Calls	Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters. In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?" If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department. Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group. And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential. Thank you.	0
Increased Security at Enron Center	Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center. We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit. Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further. Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.	2

TE Pipeline Conditions	TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE) is considering restrictions of Interruptible and Secondary services to be effective January 3, 2002 for Market Zone 3. Weather forecasts indicate colder conditions are scheduled to arrive in the market area Thursday and continue at least through the weekend. In anticipation TE will post these restrictions, if any, Wednesday morning, January 2, 2002. All OBA parties should match physical volumes with scheduled volumes. Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any questions.	1
TE Imbalances	In anticipation of colder weather scheduled to arrive in TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION's (TE) market area, all TABS-1 parties must be balanced. TE is prepared to force balance TABS-1 pools, if necessary, in order to maintain system balance and in order to meet scheduled firm services. All supply side parties should verify that physical receipts equal deliveries. Market side volumes should be commensurate with scheduled receipt volumes. Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any questions.	1
AGT Pipe Line Conditions	Weather forecasts for the ALGONQUIN GAS TRANSMISSION (AGT) system suggest colder conditions beginning Thursday, January 3, 2002. Throughputs are currently approaching capacity at critical points on the AGT system therefore restrictions of lower priority transportation may need to be instituted with the onset of anticipated higher demand. Customers are reminded of the importance of scheduled such that deliveries are commensurate with receipts.	0
TE Critical System Warning	TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001. Based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below, Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until further notice. Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season. At this time, Texas Eastern's storage capacity is approximately 98% full. As a result, there is virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual imbalances left on the system. Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system match actual customer takes in the market area. No due pipe gas will be accepted into the system until further notice. If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an operational flow order ("OFO") requiring actual receipts of gas to match actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm. In addition, and as provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.	1

Notice to Employees of Bankruptcy Court Order	This is to inform you that on January 25, 2002 the Honorable Arthur Gonzalez, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered an order as follows: It is hereby Ordered that until further Order of this Court, Enron Corp., its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered chapter 11 proceedings (collectively "Enron"), and Enron's employees shall preserve, and refrain from destroying or disposing of, any of Enron's records, either in electronic or paper form. Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences. We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully. Thank you.	0
PG&E BANKRUPTCY CASE-- IMPORTANT	As you may be aware, Enron Corp. is a member of the Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee appointed in the Pacific Gas and Electric Company bankruptcy case. Michael Tribolet with the Risk Assessment and Control Group is Enron's designated representative on the committee and he is being assisted by Lisa Mellencamp in the Enron North America Corp. legal group. Please be advised that they will be restricted from disclosing certain of the information that they receive. Attached are Ethical Wall Procedures regarding confidential information that Enron may receive as a member of the committee. It is important that you read the procedures promptly, print the Employee Certification attached and sign and return the Employee Certification to the Compliance Department as directed.	0
Program Changes	As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history. We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition. It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs. ? ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program. The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders. Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored. Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service. Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ? Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely. As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations. Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored. We regret that we have had to make these changes. We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.	1
-	Please ring Draper at AEP Current position: We have paid them all of the margin they have contractual rights for - $33.5mm gone out today which is margin under our financial gas contract. However, they want full collateral on all of their power position (this is being driven by Bill Reid on their power floor -ex Enron employee), the amount is another $220mm (they have no collateral rights to this). Essentially, the credit guy (Frank Hilton) is hurting us in the market and anything you can do to help is appreciated. I believe some of this is vindictive behaviour from an ex-employee and senior management may not know what he is up to. Louise Tel 011447778757656 (care of Rick's email)	0
Solicitation Calls	Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters. In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?" If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department. Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group. And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential. Thank you.	0
Increased Security at Enron Center	Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center. We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit. Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further. Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.	2
mportant Announcement Regarding Document Preservation	As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions. You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously. In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages	The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide. Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages. We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures. However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again. To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.	1
