Judge's Final SE RTO Mediation Report + CN summary	The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast P= ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation.=20 =20 ** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS: FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo= del (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remainin= g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process. Ho= wever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de= termination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a = platform for the SE Power Grid RTO. This should be done by FERC quickly. = There should be no further delay. Regardless of the model, FERC should enc= ourage the collaborative process. She thinks that this should be done by t= he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER= C orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down= ). Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m= odel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit = a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter. She recommends to FERC that pa= rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco= mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc= tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.) The Commission= will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he= r recommendations, or change something. I would expect that the Commission= would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t= ype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg= ested changes). Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of= the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde= r participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her). Wh= ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not ad= opt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day = 2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented). =20 The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the G= rid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (with= out any changes).

This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid = model. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, et= al.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) = in her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model i= s not Order No. 2000 compliant. The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid phy= sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a= nd LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsib= ilities. The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below:=20 Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and = an enhancement: the Independent Market Administrator (IMA). The IMA was a= dded to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission ow= ner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission = solutions over generation or other transmission solution). The IMA would a= dminister the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission= system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and tra= nsmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function. She str= ongly encourages this split.=20 Good stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) = and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets=20 Allows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), wi= th RTO oversight=20 Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control= areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pur= suant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA. Recognizes that con= solidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures. (Protocols should be= subject to further discussion)=20 RTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including= rate changes and tariff filings=20 All load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has= appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their = rights should they win on appeal)=20 4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and G= ridFlorida. Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant t= ransmission. Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existin= g facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those abo= ve). There will be one "through and out rate", plus a Grid Management Char= ge for RTO operation.=20 Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT=20 Financial Rights/LMP (includes "real time spot market") is clearly the pref= erred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many = details need to be worked out in continued discussions.

(1) Many a= re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a "cost-benefit" analysis an= d had concerns over the costs. She responds that extrapolation of costs to= the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the "economies of s= cale" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure. = In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process= that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shiftin= g: mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo= wed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t= ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a= ssets. (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re= tail open access (concerns with Cal.) Judge encourages the Commission to u= tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners= . I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the = extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant "jump sta= rt" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud= ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions. Furthermore, the in= itial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a "b= est practices" PJM/SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L= MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b= oard structure that accommodates a for-profit RTO entity with a significant= stakeholder advisory process. The Commission should consider utilize the = fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions, or, at a mini= mum, consider similar mediated "jump starts."=20 =20 =20 -----Original Message----- From: Bobbie McCartney [mailto:bobbie.mccartney@ferc.fed.us] Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 4:05 PM To: mddesselle@aep.com; john.a.cohen@bakernet.com; mcrosswh@balch.com; dex@= bbrslaw.com; FHR@bbrslaw.com; fochsenhirt@bbrslaw.com; mrossi@bdrnet.com; j= lphillips@calpine.com; JRegnery@calpine.com; tkaslow@calpine.com; OHaraC@ds= mo.com; mary.doyle@dynegy.com; jhughes@elcon.org; Nicolay, Christi L.; JCas= hin@epsa.org; charles_askey@fpl.com; steved@gdsassoc.com; GHobday@HHLAW.com= ; jschneid@huberlaw.com; richard.spring@kcpl.com; jpalermo@kemaconsulting.c= om; RLAMKIN@LLGM.com; relliott@mbolaw.com; beth.bradley@mirant.com; ndaggs@= mwe.com; paul.savage@nrgenergy.com; ron_lanclos@oxy.com; billdegrandis@paul= hastings.com; MaryCochran@psc.state.ar.us; Pauline.Foley@pseg.com; linxwile= rj@safferassoc.com; twoodbury@seminole-electric.com; bobg@sepa.doe.gov; lee= r@sepa.doe.gov; msmith@sf-firm.com; GLBERNST@skadden.com; gary.newell@spieg= elmcd.com; nbrown@spp.org; dacrabtree@tecoenergy.com; jrdalrymple@tva.gov; = jpwest@westlawpc.com; Jane.Mudgett@Williams.com; SMALL@wrightlaw.com Cc: Herbert Tate; Jonathan Siems; Laura Sheppeard Subject: RE: Final SE RTO Mediation Report Pursuant to the agreement of the parties, service of the attached document = is hereby effected on this Restricted Service List, which has been previous= ly approved in this Docket, via this email. =20 =20 Please note that there are a total of six attachments, only five of which = can be sent via email.

RE: ECTRIC Team	The situation from where I sit is fairly uncertain - as I understand it Corp has rejected our proposal and we are not sure under what authority or funding we are operating. The preliminary list of names is as follows. This list changes each day and includes both current employees and onew we need to get back. A good number of these will be leaving today and not returning until I can give them some certainty on coninued employment and a retention plan. If that happens, value lost to Corp. will be significant. Eric Shaw Naomi Connell Mary Nell Browning Melissa Allen Janine Juggins Marcus Von Bock Kathy Tibbs Ted Murphy Rod Nelson Cindy Horn Chris Mahoney (+small team tba) Ralph Jaeger David Williams Rob Sexton Sally Bennett James Vickerman Pauline Wilson [HR] [Cash Management] The proposed scope is not just ECTRIC but also ECT Europe Inc. and orderly wind up of european companies and operations. Please let me know how to proceed.	1
FW: Enron Europe Organization Announcement- VOLUNTARY LAYOFFS	-----Original Message----- From: Fraser, Jennifer Sent: Friday, October 05, 2001 4:18 AM To: Arnold, John Subject: FW: Enron Europe Organization Announcement- VOLUNTARY LAYOFFS Enron has had a very good year to date and we at Enron Europe have played our part in this. However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews. We are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas. We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the "back burner"and reduce the scope of others. This will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track. To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance. Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October. We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand. Please feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920. We firmly believe that if we work hard together now to achieve these short term goals, we will create a stronger, more flexible team at Enron which will be better placed than ever to grow our business in Europe.

RE: Middle Market Group	If, at it now appears is the case, that Rosman, Choi and Malowney shift over to report to Calger, we are soon going to have legal resource allocation political risk. We need to talk to Elizabeth about hedging this risk soon.----cgy	2
