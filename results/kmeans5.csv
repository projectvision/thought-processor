Access Card Information	Dear Colleagues, We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday. I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity. We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days. David Oxley Head, Human Resources ____________________________________________________________________ Access Cards There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors. Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up. There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have. It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise. Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter: 5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , The Sky Ring Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building. Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter: Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor Ardmore Data Center. Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees. Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).	1

Concerned Counter parties	Louise, Sempra Energy has called and asked to "cover' outstanding positions with Enron. They have done some deals with me this morning via EOL, as well as a "sleeve" with EPNG in order to minimize their exposure with us. Indications were that they have longer dated power and other gas positions that they want to minimize as well, I advised them to call the respected traders first, as apposed to calling voice brokers, to see what they can facilitate.	0

SEC Information/Earnings Restatement	Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions. We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The information provides further details about: -- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge; -- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications; -- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; -- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and -- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees. This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC. As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses. Restatement of Earnings Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001. These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position. Here are some details included in the filing: Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments. Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include: -- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997 -- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998 -- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 -- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000 -- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 -- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001 -- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001. The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000. The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001. You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>. We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.	2

IMPORTANT VIDEO ANNOUNCEMENT	I have a very important video announcement about the future of our company. Please go to <http://home.enron.com/message/> to access the video. Thank you.	2
FW: Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call	Listened in on the analyst call this morning. Here are my notes. Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order. The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements. Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds. Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call. Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them. Specific points: EES will be a part of the new company. Enron assets will be revalued at closing. The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred. If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration. If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred. Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%. Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative. ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity. Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage. In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings. Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true. Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM. Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'. All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks. Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure. Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way. Lay: had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs. Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there. Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash. Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing. Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing. With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible. However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash. ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks. BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies. McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks. Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing. EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there. The big integration effort will be ENA. Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets. Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model. They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that. Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies. Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger. Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses. Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing. McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements. ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list. The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron. Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities. McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized. Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates. Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies. Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity. Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash. ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed). Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices. ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'. (No further clarification given). Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner. They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination. They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained. Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions. He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.' Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today. Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player. He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well. Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.	2
FW: Sanders Morris analyst piece on Enron	Jim, Do you remember Rob Lloyd? He know works at AIM Funds here in town. Please read the piece below - I think it is well written and summarizes our sad situation succinctly. Regards, Jean -----Original Message----- From: Lloyd, Robert J [mailto:Robert_Lloyd@AIMFUNDS.COM] Sent: Tuesday, November 13, 2001 9:41 AM To: Mrha, Jean Subject: Sanders Morris analyst piece on Enron Jean, Thought you'd find this interesting. It's an excerpt from an analyst's note out this AM. A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron: It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse, but only 24 days for it to disintegrate. The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in various off balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparently became too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings, their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated into something beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began 30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al) sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. They involved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value (asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. This allowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity. If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: very New Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained, to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as the latest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of the table in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJM partnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC. Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passed muster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporized in the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It had used up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If these were fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.	0

FW: Logistics Commercial Realignment	-----Original Message----- From: Choate, Heather Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 8:51 AM To: Neal, Scott; Shively, Hunter S.; Grigsby, Mike; Lagrasta, Fred; Martin, Thomas A.

This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows: Wholesale Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively. Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby. Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta. Retail Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team. Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Assistants - Please forward on to your groups.	0

FW: New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals	fyi... -----Original Message----- From: Cantrell, Rebecca W. Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 11:16 AM To: Concannon, Ruth; Townsend, Judy; Lamadrid, Victor; Muhl, Gil; Superty, Robert; Calcagno, Suzanne; McMichael Jr., Ed; Smith, George F.; Pollan, Sylvia S.; Kinsey, Lisa; Luce, Laura; Shireman, Kristann; Miller, Stephanie; Lucci, Paul T.; Gay, Randall L.; Sullivan, Patti; Hodge, John; Tholt, Jane M.; Kuykendall, Tori; Mahmassani, Souad; South, Steven P.; Shively, Hunter S.; Grigsby, Mike; Neal, Scott; Gomez, Julie A.; Sullivan, Colleen Cc: Steffes, James D.; Lawner, Leslie; Neustaedter, Robert Subject: New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals. The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done. These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative. Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny. FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates. During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was "important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side," that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines." Last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend," he asserted. In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment. FERC declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers. In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs. The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package, "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order. Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an "adequate alternative," the commission observed. "However, if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not include any such provision." A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk, giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers," the commission pointed out. "A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges," FERC said, adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner." Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language "will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers." Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become "muddled." Through a "tortured line of cases," FERC's definitions of allowable contracting practices were "obscured," Breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense" approach. The "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers, she said.	0
RE: BUG Rebooking	Andy Ring and Sandra Brawner need to be at this meeting. -----Original Message----- From: Little, Kelli Sent: Monday, November 26, 2001 3:43 PM To: Neal, Scott Subject: RE: BUG Rebooking Maureen Smith and Ruth Concannon have raised some issues regarding how Brooklyn Union Gas is in the books, specifically, the final contract year (11/1/03 - 10/31/04) is not in the books at all (which will produce a gain when booked), and the current deal structure is telescoped incorrectly at Transco Zones 1,3, & 4 when it should be telescoped 17% at Zone 1, 25% at Zone 2, and 58% at Zone 3. This will produce a slight loss when rebooked, but the gain from booking the final year is more than enough to offset the loss. The purpose of tomorrow is to review that issues and valuations with you & Frank before making any changes to the books. Please let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks!	0

FW: TE Critical System Warning	FYI... Chris -----Original Message----- From: infopost@duke-energy.com [mailto:infopost@duke-energy.com] Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 12:00 AM To: infopost@duke-energy.com Subject: TE Critical System Warning November 27, 2001 TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001. Based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below, Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until further notice. Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season. At this time, Texas Eastern's storage capacity is approximately 98% full. As a result, there is virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual imbalances left on the system. Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system match actual customer takes in the market area. No due pipe gas will be accepted into the system until further notice. If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an operational flow order ("OFO") requiring actual receipts of gas to match actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm. In addition, and as provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.	0

Online Trading Simulation	We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from 0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete. Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

Regional Research Projects	All, The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11. Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03. As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.) We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with. Please note that, as a result, we may "only" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions. Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name. Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7). Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty. Have a goodie.

Online Launch Plan Update	With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

Curves and scalars	Mike, When you evaluate your curves and scalars for the OG&E area, can you also make sure your Entergy long term curves and scalars are in good shape?

I assume the scalars would not be much different for either area, but I wanted to make sure they were both updated. Thanks.	0

CURVES	Mike, The change in the curves only shows a .60 increase today. The curves were down anywhere from .60 to 1.65 previous which was supposed to be up .25. Cin was up @ .15 today. That would mean that ENT should be up at least the amount it was down the previous day plus any increase marked today. Can you look into this for me.

Retail Competition In Texas - Internal Communication	INTERNAL COMMUNICATION REGARDING DELAYS IN RETAIL COMPETITION IN TEXAS October 29, 2001 The main purpose of this memo is to inform EPMI and EES commercial teams regarding the implementation status of retail competition Texas, particularly in non-ERCOT regions, which include parts of the areas served by the following utilities: ? Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) and West Texas Utilities Company (WTU) - both in the SPP region ? Entergy Gulf States (EGSI) - in the Energy-SERC region As most of you probably have heard, the Texas Utility Commission has been examining, in the last few weeks, the readiness to implement retail competition in those areas. The Public Utility Commission of Texas (Staff) has filed petitions seeking a determination of whether market institutions are ready for retail competition in above areas, to start January 01, 2002. There is a concern among the Commission and many other participants that non-ERCOT-Texas regions are not ready for competition. This concern has two major causes: - Lack of a vibrant, efficient wholesale market in those regions, where newly established REPs could have full access to others suppliers, on a non-discriminatory basis - Lack of success in the retail pilot programs developed in 2001 - no alternative suppliers and no customer shifting at all; a recent hearing has confirmed most REPs absolute lack of interest in those regions - at least for the time being SPP Last Week, the Public Utility Commission decided to delay competition in SPP Texas. Or, more accurately, "to delay customer choice", in the Commission preferred language. Enron, who was requested to file a testimony, opposed to any delays, under the argument that SPP is not a "perfect market", but REPs could trade in this market as other marketers do. No final dates have been established yet. However, one estimates that the delay may vary from 12 to 18 months. The Commission has established some clear actions and milestones before retail competition is implemented: - Support SPP to begin wholesale market operations, which involves refinements and upgrades in a few of existing systems, such as settlement; - Reform in SPP Tariffs and implementation of a market based congestion management; - Continue the pilot, attract new competitors and open the market. As part of this effort, the Commission created a Southwest Power Pool Market Readiness Implementation Project (Docket # 24869) to develop the necessary steps to transition to full competition, identify milestones, monitor progress and report to the Commission on a regular basis. Enron will be supporting this effort. SERC SERC regions bear resemblance with SPP, in terms of Commission's intent to delay competition. The most important difference is that the incumbent utility, EGSI, an Entergy subsidiary, has strongly supported timely implementation. The Commission fears that Entergy will benefit from its "monopolistic" position in the region, in the absence of other REPs. No final decisions have been made yet. Entergy Gulf States, in conjunction with the Commission Staff and other interested parties have gone through a settlement process, whereby retail competition will be delayed until September 15, 2002. The subject is still being examined by the Commission and no final decisions have been made. However, we expect the Commission to approve the Settlement Agreement, therefore delaying competition until September 15, 2002. ERCOT All the discussion about delays in competition focuses on non-ERCOT Texas only. There are rumors and ongoing discussions about delaying competition in ERCOT-Texas, which is scheduled to take place on January 01, 2002. For example, Nancy Hetrich from Enron, will be attending the Legislative Oversight Committee on Friday, November 02. She will be appearing in her capacity of Chair of RMS Sub-Committee. Contrary to non-ERCOT, there is a strong support from most industry participants to have retail competition on time. Besides, the results from the pilots were successful and ERCOT is supposed to provide vibrant wholesale competition. Therefore, unlike SPP and Entergy, there should be no material reasons or fears to delay retail competition in ERCOT-Texas. We will keep you apprised as things evolve.	0

Entergy joins SETRANS (southern, etal) RTO	Entergy has joined the SE Trans RTO (Southern, etal). I will review the FERC filing; however, an Entergy rep called me today to ask for Enron's support stating that the new RTO proposal includes: -- Independent Market Operator (he said such as PJM) -- No Day Ahead Balanced Schedules -- LMP -- One OASIS and one Tariff (no separate tariff for Entergy's ITC) -- One Security Coordinator -- Initial license plate rate within Entergy area -- local planning in Entergy footprint He also said that they are trying to have the GridSouth group agree to use the same Independent Market Operator so there would be one market structure for the Southeast. Hopefully, the filing reflects this -- more later. Christi	0

FW: FERC Enacts Major Constraints on Wholesale Market	November 27, 2001 FERC Enacts Major Constraints=20 on Wholesale Market By Will McNamara Director, Electric Industry Analysis AEP, Entergy Corp. and Southern Company told by FERC to charge cost-based p= rices instead of market-based prices for wholesale spot transactions.=20 [News item from Reuters] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FER= C) voted 3-1 last week to adopt new rules to measure market power, as a con= dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe= r in the wholesale market. FERC commissioners said the new test would impro= ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market = last winter, when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight = supplies. FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base= d on supply margin assessments, which examines a company's importance in se= rving peak electricity loads. "If you're big enough to control the market a= t the time we look at it, you'll have mitigation put on you," said FERC Cha= irman Pat Wood.=20 Analysis: Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry = are still reeling from FERC's new ruling, which may have slipped past some = radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday = weekend. This is a mammoth ruling on FERC's part, however, and it holds tre= mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share = of their profits coming from wholesale transactions. In addition, state reg= ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates,= which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin= king profits in their wholesale operations. While FERC has presented this r= uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience= d in the California market, the new limits on wholesale transactions can al= so be seen as another example of the "big stick" that the commission is usi= ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat= ions (RTO). Further, the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma= n Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m= arkets while still attempting to support competition. The objective represe= nts a tall order, and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom= pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading.=20 Put into a nutshell, FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg= e unregulated, market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions. I= nstead, companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of= an approved RTO must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committ= ed in a long-term contract, and publicly disclose those cost-based prices. = Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), Atlanta-based Sou= thern Company (NYSE: SO) and New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) ha= ve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply= ing its new standards for wholesale transactions. Note that Mirant Corp., a= former subsidiary of Southern Company, has also been identified as having = to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s= eparate from its former parent. The commission has essentially determined t= hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the= areas in which they operate. Under FERC's new market power "test," a gener= ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici= ty is "pivotal" during peak demand, which enables the company to demand a p= rice above competitive levels. Regional transmission constraints will also = be considered now as a measurement of a company's market power. This is a d= ramatic departure from previous standards, by which (under one of FERC's ma= in criterions) a company that supplied less than 20 percent of the power ne= eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l= evel.=20 There are some important exceptions to the ruling. First, FERC has not elim= inated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where t= he grid and markets are controlled by a FERC-approved RTO. This is signific= ant, as I will expand upon subsequently, because it indicates that there ar= e secondary objectives in FERC's new ruling. In addition, the current rulin= g only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities= are involved. In other words, long-term contracts that the three companies= may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im= pacted by the ruling. However, the three companies named in the ruling will= have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts, and FERC = has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term co= ntracts may be necessary. Also note that the Western market, which already = is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June, was not inclu= ded in the new ruling.=20 The three utilities named in the ruling now have 15 days to submit proposal= s to FERC outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for= all power not currently committed to a buyer. Specifically, the utilities = will have to post on their open-access same-time information systems (OASIS= ) the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour = in a 24-hour period. Moving forward, the price that the utilities can charg= e for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between= their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region= that their power displaces. The new cost-based rates must be administered = by an independent third party.=20 The new pricing standards revert back to an older, cost-based technique kno= wn as "split the savings." The methodology for this standard can get rather= complicated, but essentially under FERC's new ruling the three companies i= dentified will have to post their cost-based, incremental costs for spot po= wer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases. Purchasers wh= o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci= ng or buying the power on their own. The final price for the transactions w= ill be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decr= emental bid. For instance, if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at= $20/MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $30/MWh, the transact= ion price would be $25/MWh. Assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day, se= llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da= y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by 6 p.m. What this potent= ially creates is an "information advantage" for buyers who have six hours t= o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers. Some of t= he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price= information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th= e purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original in= cremental bid and competing around the seller's price.=20 Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad= investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new = market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means i= s that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, = it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b= elieves to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are = awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th= ey exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power= providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within = 60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the c= ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred.=20 I made a previous reference to the "big stick" that FERC is carrying relate= d to participation in RTOs. Remember that a few months ago, Chairman Wood h= ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of= charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli= cations, advantages that the chairman equated with the "new world" of the d= eregulated energy market. With this in mind, note that only Southern Compan= y, Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling (although it may be s= ubsequently expanded). Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi= bited some resistance in following FERC's consolidation mandate regarding n= ational RTOs, so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti= lities have been singled out. This must be particularly painful for Souther= n Company, which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an= d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov= er the next five years.=20 Interestingly, Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss= enting vote in the ruling. Breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been= pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu= ate the impact on wholesale markets. This issue will undoubtedly be contest= ed, and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to = have been caught off-guard. AEP, Entergy and Southern Company all issued st= atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t= he ruling would impact them, and that they were reserving the right for pos= sible litigation.=20 Moreover, to summarize the commission's rulemaking, I think there are a han= dful of important points that should be considered. First, the ruling illus= trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke market-price authority that = was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed = his post as chairman. Second, FERC is implementing cost-based prices on the= spot market only, and in only very defined circumstances. However, this co= uld be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to o= ther wholesale transactions, including long-term contracts, at a later time= . Third, the "split the savings" cost-based formula could become fraught wi= th its own problems. Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the = potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov= er power sellers, which will now be required to post incremental costs in t= he bidding process. Finally, one of the inherent drivers of FERC's new ruli= ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission = has approved. It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact= s AEP, Entergy and Southern Company, utilities that have not only been deem= ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a= lso not yet joined an approved RTO. However, even though only three compani= es are immediately impacted by this ruling, it should not be overlooked tha= t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi= ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain = areas. Thus, overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s= ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power= market are conducted.=20 An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available at www.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20 _____ =20 We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.

FW:	Cindy: Here's some basic data on this ee: Date of Hire: 12/18/2000 Supervisor: James Scribner Bus. Unit: ENW - Energy Operations Mid Yr. 01 Rating: 5 Comments: Scribner became supervisor when Tammie's previous supervisor left Enron (approx. mid yr.). Short tenure with Enron may be part of the reason why her relative ranking was a 5. (HR rep is researching and will confirm) HR Rep has met with supervisor and assured me perf. review will be done this week. The HR rep also spoke with Tammie. We are addressing Tammie's question in the last sentence below. As a result of her MY01 rating, she would normally get a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) in addition to her performance review. Due to the review being so overdue, my recommendation would be to drop the PIP and only do the review as it is unreasonable to expect Tammie could accomplish the milestones in her PIP by the time her group does their PRC meeting (M. Cash to provide legal opinion on this issue). I have advised the HR Rep and supervisor to further explain to Tammie the relative ranking process and the role it plays in Enron's culture and ongoing performance management process. I'll forward additional information as I receive it. cs	0

N-Form clarification	Hi Team, Just wanted to clarify some decisions arising out of last week's N-Form Team meeting regarding the Working Environment policy... Remove the phrase, "...and the use of other tobacco products..." from the activities limited by our smoking policy, as employees in field locations regularly use these products, and enforcement would be virtually impossible. Clarify acceptable locations for smoking activity, as the definition for "workplace" used for alcohol and drugs is too narrow for smoking. Review "workplace" definition...this is a composite from several sources...please provide feedback as to whether it should be revised, i.e. Michelle suggested adding "parking lots." Workplace - Includes all Enron premises and any location where company business is being conducted or in which employees perform essential job functions, including all property, land, onshore and offshore platforms, office buildings, structures, installations, training facilities, plants, pipelines, boats, aircraft, and vehicles which are Enron-owned, leased, used, or operated, or which are located on Company property; as well as fenced areas to which general public access is denied or limited by Enron. Also covered are any personal effects or items, including desks, lockers, workstations, personal belongings, and privately owned vehicles located on or in Company property. Leave in the phrase, "...attending an Enron-sponsored function off Company premises..." in referencing locations where an employee should not be impaired by alcohol or drugs, as reasonable efforts are made to provide safe transportation and/or other options for impaired employees at Enron-sponsored social functions. Add references to the state and federal Drug Free Workplace Act and non-DOT policies. Stance on driving safety proposal is to state that the use of communication devices while driving poses a significant risk and that employees should comply with applicable law and business unit practices. Michelle - in your notes, you commented, "What about drug testing?" How much and which information would you like to see on this topic? Have I missed anything? Thanks so much for your time and assistance, Karen	2

Employment Tax Refund Project	Michelle, As I indicated in my voice mail this morning, I am working with Janice Priddy, Manager of Enron Corporate Payroll, on a significant employment tax refund project. We are in the process of quantifying potential FICA, federal unemployment and state unemployment tax refunds related to both internal and external acquisitions involving employees. Essentially, if we are able to determine that the predecessor company had beneficial unemployment tax rates, we may be in a position to either retroactively or prospectively take advantage of those rates. In addition, mid-year transactions may also result in a refund of amounts paid by Enron in excess of certain federal and state wage bases (Enron may be entitled to take credit for those wages paid by the acquired company prior to, but during the same calendar year, as the transaction). We obtained Enron Corporate Data Sheets from Kate Cole and Deborah Korkmas was designated as a legal contact related to several external acquisitions. We have prepared a short, one page questionnaire, which will assist us in determining whether a significant refund opportunity exists related to these particular acquisitions. According to the Corporate Date Sheets, Deborah is the legal contact for the following acquisitions: 2000 - Garden State Paper Company, LLC (FEIN: 94-3371710) 2000 - KUCC Cleburne, LLC (FEIN: not listed) 2000 - Tenaska IV Partners, Ltd. (FEIN: not listed) 2000 - Harrier Power Corporation (FEIN: not listed) Please complete the attached questionnaire for each acquisition with as much information as possible. If the acquisition did not involve employees, just complete the top portion of the questionnaire and answer questions 1 and 2. In reference to question 5, since it is unlikely that you have access to such detailed payroll information, if you could provide the states in which the predecessor had employment, we will then be in a position to contact state agencies to gather more detailed information. Thank you for your assistance in this process. If you have any questions, please call me at (713) 237-5346 or Janice at x37839. Once the questionnaires have been completed, please return them to me via e-mail at alexa.r.cutter@us.andersen.com. Sincerely,	2
Proposed Discipline for Internet Violations	The proposed discipline below is designed to provide guidelines for HR generalists in addressing violations of the "Internet Security Policy for the use of Electronic Media and Services" to ensure consistency in the application of disciplinary measures. In general, the discipline should follow the corrective action policy that has been established for addressing unacceptable conduct (see policy #11, corrective discipline). The recommendations below are designed to address situations where employees transmit externally electronic communication that is "discriminatory, harassing, threatening, derogatory, obscene, defamatory, a "chain letter" or junk mail, untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest or for personal profit" (as outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics). First Offense: Automated electronic warning that the system has detected an inappropriate electronic mail being sent from the employee's mail box and that another violation will result in the HR Representative and Supervisor being notified and possible disciplinary action. Also warning message refers employee to Internet Security Policy. Second Offense: Second automated electronic warning to employee with copy to HR Rep and Supervisor. HR Rep and Supervisor to verbally warn employee to ensure understanding of Company policy. Third Offense: Third automated electronic warning to employee with a copy to Supervisor and HR. HR Rep and Supervisor to give Written warning to employee to be placed in PH file. Written warning to state that further violation may result in termination. Fourth Offense: System notice of shut down for continuing violation. Copy of notice sent to HR Rep and Supervisor. HR Rep and Supervisor to consult with Legal depart prior to employee termination for misconduct. Using these guidelines, it is suggested that the HR Rep and Management consider the specifics of the offense and determine the appropriate corrective action. Other Issues/Considerations: Should we carve out transmissions that are "untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest and for personal profit" and have a more severe discipline for those situations? Should same discipline be used when employees access inappropriate or pornographic sites. Should we attempt to define all terms? Is it appropriate to use a "one size fit's all" approach. Should the discipline for transmitting motivational messages be the same as discipline for a threatening, obscene, derogatory, etc. message? How should we address inappropriate electronic messages transmitted internally? Please route your comments to me or be prepared to discuss at our next meeting to be held Monday, July 23rd from 10:30 am to 11:30 am in EB 3824. Valeria	0

Revised Section 3.4B	Michelle, here is a suggested revision to Section 3.4 B which I believe will accomplish the objective we discussed. We need to draft procedures to be adopted by the Committee. B. If a terminated employee who is entitled to receive a severance benefit under the Plan receives a notification of layoff from Enron in compliance with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, is placed on a period of paid leave of absence or furlough before termination of employment by Enron, and continues on the payroll of Enron for such period, the severance benefit payable under the Plan shall be reduced and offset, in a manner prescribed in procedures established by the Committee, by the amount of pay received by such employee during such period.

Revised statistics	Kriste: Here is a chart prepared by our statistician indicating adverse impact based on the spreadsheet that we received on Monday. As we have discussed before, the more relevant statistics are the job group numbers and not the gross statistics. Allan King also called me after he sent me this and said that Rob Speakman (the statistician) also said that he was able to compare the HR staff selected for layoff versus the HR general population and there was statistically significant adverse impact of 10 on gender and 12 on African-American. He asked if this group was selected as a group or if this was an amalgamation of HR employees from the various operating companies. I said that I thought that there was at least a component of a centralized decisionmaking. Accordingly, we probably need to discuss those statistics. Give me a call when you receive this.	0

Anyhow, here are the names and latest numbers: cash r.stock Hunter Shively 1250000 1250000 Tim Belden 1250000 1250000 John Arnold 1250000 1250000 Mike Swerzbin 750000 750000 Fletch Sturm 750000 750000 Matt Motley 750000 750000 Philip Allen 750000 750000 Rob Milnthorp 750000 750000 Chris Calger 750000 750000 Kevin Presto 750000 750000 Dana Davis 750000 750000 Rob Benson 700000 700000 John Zufferli 650000 650000 Mike Grigsby 500000 500000 Mike Maggi 500000 500000 My personal office confidential fax number is 713-646-4723.

Retention Agreement	Mich, Lavo wants to do following: Draft a cover letter that says "Attached is form of retention agreement which will be good at the conclusion of the auction on Jan 10/11, no matter who the counter party is, providing however that the successful bidder will at least 1. Have a bonus pool of at least 15% of EBIT if NETCO makes it forecasted earnings 2. Is at least AA credit rated 3. Agrees to the other provisions in the draft ASA relative to honoring Enron service and other employee matters.

Indonesia Pulp Capacity	The attached spreadsheet contains a preliminary analysis of projected capacity growth for Indonesia through the year 2005. While I feel reasonably comfortable with the numbers and the timing of projects coming online, some additional work will be required to gain 100% confidence in this information. This should be completed within the next two weeks. In addition, as the trend of replacing mixed tropical hardwood with higher quality plantation acacia is already underway, I will make an attempt to identify the timber resources of the largest market pulp producers and when they anticipate initiating production of acacia pulp. Given the scope of this project, it may require several weeks to complete. Finally, I'm considering implementing a monitoring system similiar to the one already covering the Brazilian producers so we can accurately track activity by the Indonesian producers. The information I've seen from PPPC, and particularly RISI, does not appear to be very accurate. However, if anyone has an alternative source for shipments, production, inventory, etc. data, I'm open to suggestions. In any case, I hope this assists in shedding some light on an otherwise difficult region, and, as always, I welcome your feedback. Thanks. Karen	0

newsprint update, 11/27	Dear Team, Advance Publications' The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., is struggling to find $10 million to slash from its budget because many of its key retail advertisers have filed for bankruptcy or cut their spending. The Star-Ledger still promises to honor its famous handbook pledge not to lay off any of its nonunion employees due to a bad turn in the economy. The Star-Ledger also canceled its Christmas party, has closed a small satellite office in Newark, is offering buyouts to selected employees, and will decrease the amounts of its annual raises and bonuses. The Star-Ledger has a 410,547-weekday-circulation newspaper and about 132,449 MT in newsprint consumption. The carnage continues as the loss of advertising dollars plagues newspapers. -- The Deseret News in Salt Lake City is already getting ready to temporarily publish an a.m. edition during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. The evening newspaper would publish an additional 10,000 copies of a morning edition for single-copy customers Feb. 8-24. Potentially good news for newsprint consumption... -- Media baron Rupert Murdoch has become a father for the fifth time. Murdoch, 70, the chairman and chief executive of News Corp., married Deng, 33, in 1999 after divorcing his second wife. He has four adult children from that marriage. News Corp. owns the Fox Network and New York Post, as well as extensive newspaper stables in Australia and Britain. Just think, the newborn's maternal grandfather could be younger than her father...

Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

Valuing ERCOT Industrial Load	I met with the Research team responsible for building a model for EES and ran through the model. The model can be used to value ERCOT deals or at least we can use it as a benchmark for pricing.

STWBOM Short for 10/16	For Tuesday - STWBOM will be short 75 mw on peak @ SP15. The short is related to three day-ahead pieces which were sold @ $27.20, $28, and $27.11.

New EOL Download - PLEASE READ	FYI - I've had a few requests for changes to and enhancements of the EOL Download sheet. Dan Maxwell - of the 4th floor IT group - sent me those changes today. The download now allows you to sort by delivery point, or by hour, and has an added "refresh" feature. The date has also been reformatted to fit into our inc sheets (two digit instead of four digit year). Most importantly, the query now pulls in inter-desk swaps done on EOL. The new EOL download is saved in p://real time/increment/windows 2000/NEW EOL DOWNLOAD The sheet is still very basic and self-explanatory, so if you have anything to add, or questions about how to use it, please let me know.	0
Market Changes	Group, We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter= months. First: With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefu= lly manage the units to prevent "swinging" them and increasing the chance o= f a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the u= nit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-l= ine and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold = energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual= (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensivel= y in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they hav= e a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their mark= eting group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going for= ward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be mat= ched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the gr= oup to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as = efficiently as possible. Second: The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very= difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should = look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and hea= ters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 = through HE 20. Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. B= e sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in= with ECC. Finally: We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(= the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews a= nd the final two months of the year. Please see me with any questions regarding the system. Thank you. Bill	0
Short due to lending at PGE System for Wednesday, 10/17.	We are short at PGE system for Wednesday, 10/17/01. HE1-6, 23-24pdt, we are 13mw short (total of 104mw). This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk. Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible. Deal #821995.1	0
Parking and Lending with ST-NW	Group, Going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one point per schedule with Portland General. We will either deliver or take energy from them at Portland General System. OR we will deliver or take energy from them at Mid-C. PGE real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to or from a point other than originally prescheduled. Therefore ONLY schedule the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point. In the case below we would deliver the energy to Portland General System--NOT the MID-C. We should continue to be flexible at PGE's request. Please see me with any questions. Thanks, Bill	0
Short/Long Positions for 10/18	For Thursday - STWBOM will be short 75 mw on peak @ SP15. The three day-ahead pieces were sold @ $27.20 and $28 (BOM sales) and $29.97 (SP15 Peak Day-Ahead Index). Make real time purchases to cover the short under the STWHOURLY book. Enter an inter-desk sale from STWHOURLY to STWBOM. Then make a sale under the STWBOM book to the Cal-Imbalance to complete the deal. Also, STWBOM will be long 20 mw HE 2-5 @ PV. This is a parking deal with PNM done at $16 ($14 purchase price + $2 buy-resale fee). You'll notice we'll be long 20 mw for these hours in Real Time Position Manager. Please enter an inter-desk purchase from STWBOM under the STWHOURLY book @ PV and sell this off real time under STWHOURLY. Let me know if you have questions.	0

Changing Deals and Counterparties--	Group, Our deal with EES has changed. As Ryan indicated in his email we are now charging $3 for EES up to 100 mws, above 100 mws to 200 mws we are charging $4, above 200 mws per hour we are charging $5. However, when we have transacted with EES for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate our fee into their price for that quanity of mws. I will indicate in an email to you when this occurs. This is a bit complex but if you have questions just let me know. Also, EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border. This turned out to be a "Canadian" firm purchase on the part of Enmax. Please do not fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy. We need to treat EnMax just like ECC. We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option. MPC does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner. Finally, the NW evening peak has arrived. The NW has been extremely tight through morning and evening peaks, often over $30 to pick up... Any questions, just let me know. Thanks, Bill	0
FW: DISPLACING GAS-FIRED GENERATION	Group, Here is some input from Tony at EPE regarding running their system. I think the EPE system was run very well on October 18th, but aside from that, this email shows how closely they are watching our performance and what they expect. Let's do our best to continue to provide them with good service. Thanks, Bill -----Original Message----- From: tsoto/EPEC@epelectric.com [mailto:tsoto/EPEC@epelectric.com] Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 8:43 AM To: Williams III, Bill Cc: hpuente/EPEC@epelectric.com; PowerMarketingFolks@epelectric.com; kpeterso@epelectric.com Subject: DISPLACING GAS-FIRED GENERATION Bill, thanks for the visit we enjoyed it. It is always helpful to talk face to face and have some frank discussion regarding our current business relationship. Hopefully, we'll be able to reciprocate with a visit in the near future. On a different matter, I was going over some recent historical data and have come across some instances where I believe we have room to displace gas-fired generation with inexpensive purchased power. In order to do this, we need to tighten up our real-time operations. By this, I mean to start putting all our gas-fired generation down to their minimums and replacing it with purchased power (this would apply to the early morning hours only, since we have some take or pay gas we still have to burn some base gas but this can be done during the day when prices are higher and our loss will be less). For example, Thursday October 18, the unit commitment called for purchases of around 330 MW during the early hours (see attached unit commitment for amounts and times). We only purchased 130 MW net during this time frame. So we ended up generating around 200 mwh at around $44/mwh when purchase power was available for $19/mwh. Furthermore, there was a sale for HE 06:00 to ENRON/CAISO for $22/mwh. When we enter this sale into our costing model, the sale will result in a loss of approximately $1,000 for EPE Power Marketing since the model will use marginal cost (gas-fired generation) to cost this sale. Please look into this matter and call me if you have any questions or wish to discuss it further. (See attached file: dispatch.xls) Tony Soto Power Marketing 543-4181	0
Emergency Power Generator Testing	Group, For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power. Bill	0
WTC Power Testing	This Sunday, starting at 5:00 AM, Emergency Power Systems for the WTC Complex will shut down to test the emergency backups. This will not affect critical systems (computer room, phones, or the Real Time Group), as they are on both UPS and Generator. It will affect many of the non - critical computers and office machines on the 3rd and 4th floors of Enron. Please make every effort to power down all of your PC's and monitors when you leave for the day. Also, if you could help with a machine or 2 in your immediate area we would appreciate it. The IT group will be coming through around 4-4:30 today to power down equipment not in use and I will be in before the outage on Sunday to complete this. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the IT dept. at any time. Regards Dave Steiner	0

Evening Peak and MEETING NEXT TUESDAY at 4:30.	Group- Brace yourselves... Once more we are experiencing seasonal changes. The time zone change has pu= shed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19. These hours are now prem= ium, the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme m= orning ramp and an extreme evening ramp. Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 wi= ll have difficulty with this evening ramp. Do not count on the EPE load for= ecast to accurately identify the evening ramp. We should not suck off the g= rid. Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW. We need = to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it. We should be us= ing congestion wheels as hedges. A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel go= ing in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at= $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get award= ed all 50 mws of relief.

Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update	Gentlemen - On Saturday, we received the consent required from the lenders to serve Preliminary Termination Notices (PTNs) on MSEB under the PPA. The consent allows us to serve PTNs for basically every bad act committed by our Indian counterparts to date. We will need further lender approval to serve PTNs for future bad acts. On Saturday, we served PTNs on MSEB for (a) failure to pay certain amounts under the PPA and (b) repudiation by MSEB of the PPA. There are a few more PTNs that will be served on MSEB in early June -- the underlying defaults for these PTNs required a 60 day notice period before service of a PTN and these notices were served in early April. Paul Kraske, General Counsel of Dabhol Power Company, told me that he receives 4 Indian newspapers (including national newspapers) at his apartment. On Sunday, our service of the PTNs was the lead story in all 4 newspapers. Bruce	0

Cost Savings Initiative	Karen: Attached are my suggested revisions to your 3:00 PM draft of the intercompany memo to be released by the Office of the Chairman early next week. This collective draft now contains many of the suggestions that have been received by Steve Kean, Jim Derrick, John Sherriff and the GSS team and the questions/clarifications forwarded to me yesterday by Kevin Hannon yesterday. Air travel has been clarified to read, "Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or <http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts." This will assure coverage outside the US and access to the Enron-negotiated fares with the carriers. The car rental services section has been clarified to include insurance coverage availability. The language regarding XMS has been modified to say "Effective July 1 or the effective date of the rollout in your location, all employees will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses." Also, we are currently investigating future release dates for those locations where XMS is not yet available and plan to include such information in the FAQ's that will support this memo. The URL/Web reference in the Professional Services section has been changed to http://ibuyit.enron.com/tibco. This is the URL for iBuyit. We are currently creating the content (FAQ's, procedures, forms, and etc.) that will be available via iBuyit to support the initiative.

EML Capital Adequacy and Liquidity	Jeff / John, We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals = Limited (EML). As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi= ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und= erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint. Aft= er your review, we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss. If you co= ncur with the actions suggested, please advise. If there is any balance sh= eet, debtor/creditor or cash forecast information that you require, please = let us know. Drew Lynch, Kevin Heffron, Jonathan Marsh, and Joe Gold Introduction Enron Metals Limited (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp. = EML is one of Enron's two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service= s Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron's only remaining b= rokerage business. Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to i= ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L= ME (metals exchange) of which it is a member. As a result of this regulato= ry oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron's other b= usinesses: 1)=09EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato= ry rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus= iness. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d= isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers. 2)=09By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumst= ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients. EML's p= olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML's cond= uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship= to exist. How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th= e FSA and the LME. 3)=09Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an= d to protect against systemic risk, EML's position as a provider of liquidi= ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la= ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a co= nsequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain = prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi= tion and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA = regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc= e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem= ent. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be = used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded = as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ= irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c= ease carrying on business. 4)=09EML's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o= versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for= a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines= and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members= under the FSA's rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r= elating to directors' duties. Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem= onstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial streng= th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t= he rest of Enron. In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation = we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below. Issues Surrounding Liquidity As we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation probl= ems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased th= e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML. This was a precautio= n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML. Clearly the = goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing = of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t= he non-EML related problems of Enron. This of course needed to be accompli= shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp= any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was= concerned =20 The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains= and distributes its cash. In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML,= it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap= ital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its= day to day liquidity.=20 =20 In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purp= oses. First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (= LCH). In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater= al to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc= ement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and = the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions. Second, it= must be able to post margin to its clients. A failure to make a contractu= al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre= d to the FSA. A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-= money clients in the event that they wish to close their account. While th= ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr= ofits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest= ions. Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari= os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However ce= rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to = fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from= the rest of Enron has become a concern. EML has or is in the process of l= osing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC's, which were primarily used in lieu of c= ash at the LCH. EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC'= s. Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be= transferred. Those transfers have reduced EML's cash balance. Was the re= maining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be = withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid= ity impact. The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo= r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality. Therefore we have = agreed to start to do the following a.=09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid= ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t= he rest of the enterprise b.=09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control= as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel c.=09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints= of continuing to do business on a normal basis d.=09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basis e.=09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a= s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity f.=09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi= onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou= r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis Operational Risk =20 In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account= s and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash = needs. EML's board have been resistant to this practice for several very p= ractical reasons. First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca= ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis. I= f EML relied on Enron Corp.'s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, = it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an acco= unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either= capital or liquidity events as EML's clearing account at Citibank would be= substantially overdrawn. Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi= ght create a cascade for Enron, EML's board is reluctant to put that much f= aith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards. Capital As noted above, EML is subject to the FSA's regulatory capital rules and mu= st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis. The FSA requires th= at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum finan= cial resources requirement. For a variety of reasons, there were occasions= when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these v= iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo= rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain= s financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer = not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the= FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari= se from Enron's perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those = violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga= tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh= t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM= L's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily = basis, EML's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev= el of 130%. Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces= s capital adequacy go hand in hand. =20 Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce= narios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML 1)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte= rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral= rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH 2)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac= count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH 3)=09Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME = brokers 4)=09Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i= nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca= sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly=20 5)=09Credit exposures leading to credit losses Recommendations The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following= changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov= erall operational liquidity 1)=09To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the $125 mm s= ubordinated facility 2)=09To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm) 3)=09To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturi= ty by six months to July 2002 4)=09To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi= ts and other assets held by EML 5)=09To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch= to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol= d for calling margin 6)=09To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other th= an a select group of key relationship clients=20 7)=09To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c= ompanies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory finance Current Situation Unsecured Guaranty=09=09=09$65 mm Secured Guaranty=09=09=09$15 mm Subordinated Loans=09=09=09$107 mm EML Cash Balance:=09=09=09$59 mm Cash required to replace Withdrawn guaranty=09=09=09($20mm) EML Regulatory Capital Level:=09128% Excess Reg.

FW: ENS - Draft Form of Acceptance	Good Afternoon Attached are 2 documents in relation to final Settlement of the outstanding Delay in Start up (relating to the replacement of the previously damaged rotor) claim. One is a detailed history of the claim and the other a final acceptance notice proposed by the brokers. I have been negotiating the outstanding portion of the claim now for nearly 9 months and believe that due to the circumstance surrounding the late delivery of the rotor and the advice of external council this settlement is acceptable to ENS. Will you please advise wether you agree with accepting this sum as full and final settlement. In way of context this settlement is $750k of a possible $901k an 83% success on a claim we had been advised would not have been worth taking to arbitration if the insurers had become difficult. regards Ed Sophie. Could you please confirm that you are happy with the wording of the acceptance notice.

FW: Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR	As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday. Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning. Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern. The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern: 1) Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern. gh -----Original Message----- From: <mbaldwin@igservice.com>@ENRON Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2001 5:50 PM To: Hass, Glen Subject: Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR Glen, I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering : 1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44 2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive. P.45 3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate. This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46 4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a delivery/receipt at Ferc. 5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs proposed 55 BCF. I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P. 52 &54. 6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58 7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62 8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider. I see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63 9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO impact on TW. P.66 10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore interest. P. 75 11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be approx. $ 44.4 Million. 12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4 cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83. 13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis. No impact on TW. P.85-87 14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO impact on TW interest. P 88-100. 15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already started to "implement" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110. On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact. The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with "SoCal backbone facilities". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore customers with additional cost allocations. Points for comments 1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to build long term supply and transportation contracts. 2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants with gas scheduling certainty. 3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices. 4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during California's challenging energy markets. 5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these improvements. 6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT, TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES, PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS) I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

GIR Proceeding--I99-07-003	Below is a link to the Proposed Decision by Com. Bilas on the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding that has been lingering on the agenda for most of the year. This was just issued late last week and published today. I'm still in the process of reviewing it but the good news is that he is proposing the adoption of the Comprehensive Settlement which Transwestern helped design and supported along with most other participants. The decision does however make some modifications which may not be in our best interest i.e. the adoption of a price cap for secondary market transactions. Due to the lapse in time on this proceeding, Com. Bilas has granted participants the right to file comments by Friday, October 19, 2001. Please review and advise if you agree we should file comments (I also have a call into Mark Baldwin). Note this is 140+ pages--you may wish to review the summary and pertinent sections. http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/word_pdf/COMMENT_DECISION//10294.doc	0

Weekly Report of 3/15/02	California: California Infrastructure. FERC staff made a presentation at the March 13th meeting indicating that in-state capacity is insufficient to meet peak power demand. Staff indicated that only two favorable factors beyond the state's control that have changed since the power blackouts of a year ago: the economy and the weather. With recession, energy demand is down and therefore prices are near a five-year low. Heavy snowpack in the Pacific Northwest/California areas will provide sufficient hydropower for the upcoming summer peak periods. Staff was critical of the lack of effort made to build additional power plants to accommodate California requirements. RP00-336 El Paso Capacity. FERC staff concluded that El Paso's firm service is no longer reliable due to the Full Requirement customers growth and impact on available receipt points/capacity. Staff recommended that FR customers be converted to Contract Demand and that technical conference be scheduled.	0

updates	Dawn has given us until noon Wednesday to get them the final list of EOL products and book mappings. I know with the trader changes last Friday these will change again. The traders had a meeting this morning going over their curves, and it sounds like they are moving some curves between regions and might possibly be losing some locations. Since we will be testing everything on Thursday, we need to have our curve files ready to load on Wednesday to give a prior day curve for portcalc. The west traders are looking at theirs now, can you guys check with your traders and see if they need any changes made to the files, and let them change any links? We also need to create a curve file that the traders can get to, but doesn't give them access to any of our other files, so the current location will not be the final. We can create this tomorrow once we have converted over to UBS. Thanks KK	0

EOL products	OK, the fun continues. We need to assign EOL products to traders. Torrey sent a file (Netco\controls\Trader-Book template (US Gas)_EOL new books) with all products and the old book assignments. We need to get with the traders today and get these split out.....many will stay the same as before. Also, when physical deals are done, will all risk types go to the same desk or will one person be managing the index separately. ex. the west desk used to book all index to Grigsby's book. I have told Dawn that all risk types will go to that trader's book but if index needs to be changed let me know. Thanks KK	0

regions file	Thomas is setting up a new NGP&L file and would like us to save a copy of each P&L to Netco\2002\0102\region#0102. Once you decide how you are going to break them up, one file for each book or combine them together, can you save them out there so he can start linking them. I think that for the physical regions it may be easier to keep each book separate because people could be moving around a lot. KK	0

Mary Jo will be in my office. <<Nov13GasMtg.doc>> Darron, I would like to excuse NNG and continue our discussion after we discuss the above items.	0
Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call	Listened in on the analyst call this morning. Here are my notes. Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order. The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements. Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds. Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call. Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them. Specific points: EES will be a part of the new company. Enron assets will be revalued at closing. The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred. If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration. If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred. Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%. Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative. ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity. Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage. In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings. Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true. Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM. Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'. All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks. Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure. Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way. Lay: had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs. Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there. Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash. Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing. Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing. With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible. However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash. ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks. BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies. McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks. Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing. EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there. The big integration effort will be ENA. Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets. Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model. They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that. Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies. Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger. Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses. Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing. McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements. ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list. The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron. Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities. McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized. Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates. Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies. Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity. Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash. ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed). Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices. ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'. (No further clarification given). Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner. They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination. They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained. Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions. He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.' Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today. Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player. He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well. Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.	2
Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14	Here are my notes from today's call. As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject. Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets: Core, Non-core, and Under Review. Core: Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines Non-core: Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS). Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns. Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion. An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets. Under Review: EGM, EIM. These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability. Required resource levels are being carefully studied. Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates. Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter. These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets. Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn. Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says. Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy. Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity. Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt. McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles: Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets. It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors). The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets. Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation). The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies. The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water. As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required. If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt. This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances. Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'. It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals). As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup. Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity. The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin. Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'. The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet. McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments. Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says. Our 10Q will be filed five days late. The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles. The special committee investigation is still ongoing. The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often. The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'. Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation. McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for. That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time. Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets. Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval. However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval. Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'. (Did not catch this part clearly). The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing. $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level. Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn. No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause. Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear). The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'. The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities. The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled. Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes. He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products. Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week. Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels. It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us. McMahon: There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers. But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.' Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week. Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses. The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says. The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses. Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business. We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business. McMahon: "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity. McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week. ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us. As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.	2
FW: PROJECT 1	Here is a test of several items you have learned in the Excel class so far. I have set up a basic program structure for you that opens a file and reads the file, line by line, into the variable "sBuf". You should write functions that tally the results asked for on Sheet1 (number of lines in the file, number of characters, etc). A user should be able to enter a search (source) string. Given the string you should also search for how many times it occurs in the file under 3 different conditions (case-sensitive, case-insensitive and as a "word" - separated by blanks). You should have all the basic concepts down to complete the program fairly easily. Work on this project and we will discuss it on the Monday following Thanksgiving. I will be out tomorrow and next week. Have fun!	0

Historical Correlation Calculator	I finished a spreadsheet for calculating historical correlations on forward curves. It gives the correlation matrix for contracts going out an arbritary number of months out. I think it might be a handy tool for some of you. You may get that on O:\RESEARCH\CUSTOM\CORRELMATRIX\ It demands that you have access to our EGSPROD32 database. You must have that configured in your ODBC. It is a large spreadsheet, so it may take some computing resorces. Let me know if you find any problem. Thanks. Paulo Issler	0

Small logic error	John, I found the error. It was a small logic error. You can easily fix the problem if you go into the visual basic editor for the blotter file. In the editor, you will see several modules listed on the left of the screen under the file. You will need to edit the "Main_Query" module. Once in the "Main_Query" module, you will need to search for the routine named "VerifyManualInputs". The actual start of the routine looks like this: Function VerifyManualInputs(FromDate As String, ToDate As String, PutCall As String, Lots As String, Strike As String, Price As String, CParty As String, sType As String) As Boolean Within this routine, about 15-20 lines down, you should see the following two lines : If (isdate(FromDate) And isdate(ToDate)) Then If (ToDate < FromDate) Then You need to change the second line to : If (CDate(ToDate) < CDate(FromDate)) Then This should fix the problem. The intent of the line is to prevent the "To Date" of a deal from being earlier than the "From Date". In the original line of code, it does a TEXT based compare (like comparing is "ABC" < "DEF") instead of comparing the two values as DATES. The modification I've laid out converts the from and to dates to date values before comparing. I have tested the fix here and it should work fine. I hope everything runs smooth for you next week. Have a good Thanksgiving. Greg	0

While we will honor current commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to use the spot agreement to buy any more gas. The reason that this is happening is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now. We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of agreement most gas suppliers are familiar. We have the ordinance approved by the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep us operating. I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are doing. The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM. We will take the executed contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and, if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new year begins. This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem. I can't make any changes to this contract. There is a notice published in the LA Times about the availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying to do here. I Hope most of you will respond. Thanks (See attached file: Spot Gas Cover Letter.doc)(See attached file: New Spot Gas Contract.doc) - Spot Gas Cover Letter.doc - New Spot Gas Contract.doc	0

The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto. When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly. I will keep you posted. Thanks Anne -----Original Message----- From: Grigsby, Mike Sent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 1:54 PM To: Bike, Anne Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads How is this issue? -----Original Message----- From: Bike, Anne Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 7:15 PM To: Grigsby, Mike Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made. I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements. I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control. Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September. October will not be much different. The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP. This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned. Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt. I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings. Hopefully next week. Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens - I will let you know. We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances. We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned. I think Matt Smith was working on July. We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems. Thanks for the note on the group. I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow. I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up. We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly. It will still be slow. Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues. We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically. I will let you know the time line soon. I have a question. What does the "Wood" report mean ? See you. Anne -----Original Message----- From: Grigsby, Mike Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 8:51 PM To: Bike, Anne Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads Disregard attachments. How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin? You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply? I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world. Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal. i will never understand. is it just me? Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. By the way, you are doing a great job. It seems like your group is getting their books run early. Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions. Just a reminder. You may want to talk to them about confidentiality. You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy. Right? -----Original Message----- From: Bike, Anne Sent: Tue 9/18/2001 3:56 PM To: Grigsby, Mike Cc: Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads Mike: Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ? They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded. Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads. All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin. On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat. Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP. We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate. We have not rebooked the origination. I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal. Let me know if this clears everything up.

Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

Material Contract Review	For Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Canada Power Corp., the following is a summary of change in control provisions: 1. Current Precedent Form of Master Firm Physical Gas Agreement - there is no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 2. Current Precedent Form of Guarantee supporting the Gas Master - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 3. Current Precedent Form of Master Firm Physical Power Agreement - although there is no change in control provision, there is an "Event of Default" where a party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) into another entity and, at the time of such reorganization, the resulting entity fails to assume all the obligations of the predecessor party under that agreement (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 4. Current Precedent Form of Guarantee supporting the Power Master - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 5. Physical GTCs (Gas and Power) - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 6. ISDA - there is an "Event of Default" where one party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) and the resulting entity does not assume the obligations of the preceding entity under the ISDA. There is also a "Credit Event upon Merger" when one party or its Credit Support Provider reorganizes and the creditworthiness of the resulting entity is "materially weaker" than the predecessor entity. A Credit Event upon Merger allows the non-affected party to terminate. (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 7. Financial Omnibus - in the financial terms and conditions (Annex A) there is an "Event of Default" where a party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) into another entity and, at the time of such reorganization, either the resulting entity fails to assume all of the obligations of the Defaulting Party under the Confirmation or the resulting entity's creditworthiness is materially weaker than that of the Defaulting Party (mirroring the ISDA "Merger without Assumption" and "Credit Event upon Merger"). (individual contracts would ahve to be checked) 8. Impact Energy Subscription Agreement - no change in control provisions 9. Petro Canada Services Agreement - Section 11.4 indicates that Enron Canada ceasing to be an affiliate of Enron North America Corp. is a material breach of the agreement entitling PC to terminate the agreement in accordance with its terms. 10. Suncor Services Agreement - Article 18 allows for the termination of the agreement by Suncor if (i) there is a change in shareholding of either ECC or ENA that results in either or both ceasing to be an affiliate of Enron Corp. or (ii) ECC or ENA disposes of all or substantially all of its or their assets or (iii) ECC, ENA or Enron Corp. amalgamate, merge or consolidate into another entity other than an affiliate and such transaction would have a material adverse impact on the business on Suncor. 11. Sundance B Power Purchase Arangement - no change in control provision 12. British Energy Power Purchase Agreement - no change in control provision 13. OEFC Services Agreement - no change in control provision 14. ENERconnect Services Agreement - no change in control provision 15. SYNCRUDE Services Agreement - no change in control provision 16. CASCO Services Agreement - no change in control provision 17. Papier Masson Agreements - these were all transferred to Houston and should be checked by someone in EIM As far as trading agreements go, I believe that most if not all inter-company contracts (ie. between ECC and Enron Direct, ENA, EES, etc.) have a MAC clause relating to ownership by Enron Corp. but I am not aware of any third party trading agreements that would contain the same provision with respect to Enron Canada.	2

Brazil Update	CUIABA Furnas: Nothing particularly new to report since last week, other than it appears we are likely to get the consent documents signed Tuesday or Wednesday. These documents reflect a resolution to the consent issue and the Resolution 49 regulatory issues that changed some of the risks under the PPA. As reported last week, one of the reasons Furnas/Electrobras have agreed to sign is because the two difficult issues regarding (i) the validity of the Electrobras guaranty following privatization; and (ii) political force majeure allowing a "put" option for Brazilian governmental acts, were deleted from the Furnas consent documents and will be negotiated separately with the Brazilian government over the next two weeks. These issues must also be resolved for financing. GT11/12: Repairs still on schedule to meet requirements under the PPA for the changeover to gas by year end. Siemens and our engineers will meet with the underwriters in London tomorrow to discuss the root cause of the failures. Still no written confirmation of coverage, but we currently do not anticipate a problem. Shell: Preparing for mediation to be held in Toronto November 5-7. ANNEX V After reporting last week that the cost pass through suits had been filed, I learned that Orlando Gonzales made the commercial decision to hold off on those suits because of significant progress he made in negotiations with the Brazilian government for resolution of these issues and Annex V. Elektro received some of the information from ASMAE for calculating its numbers; however, as of Friday it had not received the information for the rationing period, the relevant period for calculating the set off. I talked with Vasco this morning and he believed this information was received today and will confirm. If the information is not forthcoming, we are prepared to file a suit to compel it. I will stay in touch with Orlando this week to determine if and when we can file these suits without interfering with his negotiations. Regards, Michelle	0

CAISO/Calpine	Wade here are the wiring instructions for two payments, one to the CAISO and one to Calpine: CAISO: $206,000 This amount represents two days' A/S and GMC charges, plus enough money to bring replenish the "3-day buffer." Calpine: $1,980,800 This represents two days' worth of energy to serve our California load. Our price was $40/MWh. By purchasing this energy from Calpine instead of the CAISO, we saved $120/MWh ($60/MWh + $100/MWh underscheduling penalty). This is a savings of approximately $6 million over the next two days.	0

Judge's Final SE RTO Mediation Report + CN summary	The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast P= ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation.=20 =20 ** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS: FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo= del (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remainin= g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process. Ho= wever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de= termination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a = platform for the SE Power Grid RTO. This should be done by FERC quickly. = There should be no further delay. Regardless of the model, FERC should enc= ourage the collaborative process. She thinks that this should be done by t= he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER= C orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down= ). Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m= odel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit = a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter. She recommends to FERC that pa= rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco= mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc= tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.) The Commission= will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he= r recommendations, or change something. I would expect that the Commission= would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t= ype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg= ested changes). Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of= the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde= r participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her). Wh= ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not ad= opt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day = 2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented). =20 The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the G= rid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (with= out any changes).

This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid = model. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, et= al.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) = in her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model i= s not Order No. 2000 compliant. The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid phy= sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a= nd LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsib= ilities. The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below:=20 Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and = an enhancement: the Independent Market Administrator (IMA). The IMA was a= dded to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission ow= ner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission = solutions over generation or other transmission solution). The IMA would a= dminister the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission= system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and tra= nsmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.

(1) Many a= re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a "cost-benefit" analysis an= d had concerns over the costs. She responds that extrapolation of costs to= the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the "economies of s= cale" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure. = In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process= that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shiftin= g: mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo= wed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t= ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a= ssets. (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re= tail open access (concerns with Cal.) Judge encourages the Commission to u= tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners= . I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the = extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant "jump sta= rt" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud= ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions. Furthermore, the in= itial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a "b= est practices" PJM/SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L= MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b= oard structure that accommodates a for-profit RTO entity with a significant= stakeholder advisory process.

New from FriedWire...	Good morning to all of you at Enron. I wanted to make you all aware of two major new capabilities that FriedWire is soon to deploy. One will be the new PJM intelligence module that will be an add-on to the existing Traffic Report. The other is a brand new version of the Traffic Report itself that incorporates real-time electricity prices and news/commentary from THE major provider of this content. FriedWire will be making some announcements shortly describing the strategic alliance between our firm and this content partner, and should be able to start showing the enhanced, jointly developed version of the Traffic Report in October. Regarding the PJM module; we are now scheduling 30-40 minute, remote (Internet-based) overviews with clients who actively trade in PJM. These will begin the week of September 24th. If any of you or your colleagues would like to participate in a very informal session that looks at the capabilities of this new tool, please contact me and I can help set-up a date and time. Some of the content and functionality in the PJM module includes: } Real time price and loadcharts that present current conditions in historical context } Real-time and day-ahead LMP data along with the public FTR data to provide a real-time estimate of FTR value } Easy interface for querying FTR data to provide competitive intelligence in the primary and secondary FTR markets } Tools for valuing FTRs in the monthly FTR auction } PJM load charts displaying PJM ISO load forecast bias } Eastern Interconnect frequency monitoring } LMP charts and maps } Customizable displays in the form of personalized Watchlists, tables and chart building tools Thanks and contact me with anything you might need.

Security Coordinator Conference Call 10-15-01	Brief from today's (October 15) daily NERC Security Call: NERC -Will reduce to Alert level 2.5, something between full alert status and heightened alert. - CIPWG continues to work on level definitions. Still a week or two away from completion. NIPC - Reports that threats are of general nature, still considered high risk and of a lasting threat. - Most reports into NIPC are presently bio-threat related. DOE - Will reduce to Level 3 modified at noon today. Note: SECON-3 is used when an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist activity exists and may increase access controls to include additional personnel and vehicle barriers. DOE had been in a SECON-2 which is used when a terrorist incident occurs or intelligence information is received indicating that some form of terrorist action is imminent, and requires specific protection measures to be put in place. SC's -There continues to be reports of "suspicious" individuals and/or groups taking pictures of power plants. -As reported on the news last night, National Guard troops are be used at Nuclear facilities in NY State. ECAR/MET Security Coordinator suggests that ECAR members continue to evaluate their security measures and take action that they deem appropriate to protect the system and their investment. ECAR/MET reminds the ECAR members that if Federal Agencies discover that one of your facilities is the target of a credible threat, that they will notify you directly of such threat. You are asked to notify the ECAR/MET Security Coordinator of any and all suspicious activities that occur on or near critical transmission facilities and power plants, as well as the appropriate law enforcement authorities. This information is for dissemination within the industry. Please do not make available to any public posting.	0

-	Hi Deskmates, Owing to the multiplicity of Logins and Passwords and URLs we are priviliged to be constantly cognisant of, I am attempting to put together and organize most of the mission critical stuff that otherwise we have had to wade around and find. The idea here is to put together URLs, Logins and Passwords, instructions from Don or Juan and ANY OTHER stuff that u might think would make our lives marginally comfortable while tooling away at our trades. I plan to do this on an ongoing basis and at no time do I think the organization will be ever considered 'over' so to speak. I would, with due permission of course, try and permanently enshrine this somewhere in M drive at a later date. So pls feel completely free to drown, deluge me with stuff u wud like to see in such place yourself. Happy organized working!!	0

-	When: Wednesday, October 31, 2001 11:00 AM-1:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada). *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Everyone is aware of the new Entergy tariff that has caused frustration for MDEA. The tariff is under appeal and money is subject to refund. However, We need a plan of action to develop as many possible options for MDEA to chose from in case the tariff stands.	0
SPP RTO	The following is a summary of filings by Entergy and SPP in compliance with FERC's March 28, 2001 order in the SPP Partnership RTO proceeding (Dockets Nos. RT01-43-000 and RT01-75-000). Please communicate any comments you have to Christi and me either today or Monday. Background: FERC found the SPP Partnership RTO proposal to be deficient and ordered the parties to provide additional information. In compliance, Entergy and SPP made filings on May 25, 2001. Entergy's compliance filing Entergy's filing provides further information on 1) efforts to expand the scope of the RTO (i.e., include others besides Entergy and the Southwest Power Pool), 2) details of the operation of the RTO and 3) congestion management. 1. Entergy's efforts to expand the RTO: Discussions with Southern Companies were fruitless as the Southern Companies have determined to pursue the development of a separate RTO. Entergy entered into an MOU with TVA to negotiate a coordination agreement to address market, seams and coordination issues between TVA and the RTO. Entergy concludes that "there does not appear to be an opportunity at this time to develop a combined regional transmission organization that extends beyond the borders of the current SPP members and Entergy," though it claims it will continue to pursue an MOU with the Southern Companies. 2. Proposed RTO protocols: The filing includes the details of proposed protocols that Entergy and SPP have developed in the following areas: Operating procedures: The procedures require Transco to operate the system in accordance with NERC operating policy and authorize Transco to perform the post-contingency actions to maintain system security. Ancillary services: Transco and SPP are each responsible for providing certain ancillary services. In addition, Transco will obtain and provide to transmission customers other ancillary services such as Black Start Service and Reliability Must Run Service. Scheduling: A single electronic scheduling system called the RTO_SS will be run by the SPP. The RTO_SS, which is initiated by the NERC E-tag, provides an electronic mechanism for approval and coordination of schedules among the parties to the transaction. RTO_SS interfaces with OASIS to retrieve the necessary information to approve schedules. OASIS Protocol: SPP and Transco will operate a unified OASIS site; the respective responsibilities of SPP and Transco are detailed in the filing. Calculation of ATC: SPP and Transco will use a single model incorporating the most up-to-date VST (VACAR, Southern, TVA) model into the SPP model for calculating ATC and TTC. The protocol contains procedures to ensure that the calculations meet certain requirements, for example, compliance with NERC principles, consistency with transmission rights, and coordination with adjoining reliability regions. System Planning: Entergy describes its system planning process as "designed to ensure transmission system reliability and non-discriminatory access to the transmission system." The planning and expansion process provides for customer input. The protocol emphasizes coordination with RTO members and non-members. Transco will be responsible for coordinating planning with transmission customers and other entities within its Control Area. Generation Interconnection: Entergy and SPP propose to use their current interconnection procedures for their respective systems while they develop a common set of procedures for the RTO. The filing includes proposed interconnection procedures that the RTO plans to have in place before initial operations begin. Dispute Management: The filing includes a comprehensive planning dispute management system for use with the proposed RTO transmission planning process. 3. Congestion Management and Market Design The filing includes proposed "cornerstone principles" for 1) the real-time market, 2) the forward market and 3) conversion of existing transmission rights. Details of these principles are as follows: Real-time market: Entergy and SPP do not propose any specific plan except that the following general principles will be used by the SPP to design the real time market: - support balanced/unbalanced and covered/uncovered schedules that flow load to take full advantage of spot market resources - support forward physical transmission rights that function as financial rights and establish priority in cases of TLR - support real-time LMP pricing as ex-post based on actual total demand and actual total generation - support the real-time market as an aggregation of bilateral and spot supplies - support the RTO's role as physical coordinator responsible for reliability, scheduling, dispatch and SPP load forecasting - minimize the RTO's need to take a position in the real-time energy markets Forward market: SPP will issue Financial Congestion Hedges. Schedules and physical delivery will be permitted without rights. The holder of an FCH will be paid rents or revenues collected from the transmission customer minus payments made to generators to relieve congestion. Conversion of existing transmission rights: Existing agreements will not lose benefits. All firm wholesale and retail customers will be entitled to a share of the FCHs. All transmission service with the point of withdrawal inside SPP will have the same priority of service. All transmission service with the point of withdrawal inside SPP will be curtailed on a non-discriminatory basis. SPP's compliance filing SPP's filing includes information that SPP claims demonstrates that the RTO satisfies the Commission's scope and configuration requirements. - SPP submitted data on wholesale energy transactions involving the SPP RTO companies, in an attempt to show that the proposed RT will be able to accommodate the full markets. - It also submitted data showing the relative insignificance of non-Entergy SERC transactions to SPP. - SPP's description of its attempts to include Southern and TVA were similar to that of Entergy. SPP states it will continue seams discussions with other regions. - SPP also reported on the Section 203 applications of SPP Transmission Owners as required by the Commission.	0

New Dialing Instructions	Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems. The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.

What This Change Means To You Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines. Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed. All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.

(01-168) Revised Implementation Date for New NYMEX Rule 9.11A	Notice # 01-168 May 17, 2001 TO: All NYMEX and COMEX Members and Member Firms FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Revised Implementation Date for New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") DATE: May 16, 2001 =========================================================== Previously, in Notice to Members #01-154, the Exchange stated that new NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") would go into effect on June 1, 2001. The Exchange is revising the implementation timeframe in order to provide Floor Members and Member Firms with additional time to obtain necessary records and become compliant with the requirements. Accordingly, please be advised that this rule now will go into effect beginning on the trade date of August 1, 2001. Further, it is anticipated that a similar rule will be implemented for the COMEX Division following final review and approval by the COMEX Governors Committee. ! In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members. ! The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted. ! Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible. ! The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account. For example, prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b) the account number; (c) the brokerage rate; (d) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (e) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information. The Compliance Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928, NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") (Entire rule is new.) Rule 9.11A Give-Up Trades In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order. The "executing broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted. (A) Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members (1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member. A Clearing Member may, in its discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account. Notice must be received by the executing broker in a timely manner. A copy of such notice shall be retained by the Clearing Member. (2). Trade Rejection. A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible. If a Clearing Member has a basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly. (3). Billing. A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing Member, customer and the executing broker. (B) Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers (1) Customer Order Placement. An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer. Once an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must: (a) confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (b) accurately execute the order according to its terms; (c) confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as practicable; and (d) transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures. 2. Use of Other Persons. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with the broker's obligations under these rules. The executing broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules. 3. Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member Authorization. Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (f) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (g) the account number; (h) the brokerage rate; (i) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (j) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information. The falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. 4. Rejection of Customer Order. Where an executing broker has confirmed Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution. The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing Member(s) of any such rejection.	0

HOLIDAY VENDOR CHOICE	Dr. Lay - The decision to go with Planners Services Group versus Extraordinary Events, TBA Inc., or Ward & Ames was made by the ONE ENRON Holiday Party Planning Committee. (Planners has an established relationship with Enron Field and coordinated ECT's Holiday party there last year.) Each vendor gave creative presentations and were very similar in capabilities. While Ward & Ames provided sound ideas in their proposal, there were a few aspects that affected the final decision. Ward and Ames' proposal was over budget when calibrated against other bids, holds an internal perception of being "controlling" vs flexible (i.e. logo launch & Portland adopted elephant event) and presentation was satisfactory but not outstanding when compared to others. Overall each of the vendors would have been capable of handling the event, but in the end Planners was unanimously selected by the Planning Committee.	0

Analyst & Associate Program - Summer Interns	I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high stakes activity this is for Enron. Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months.

"FAST BREAK" for Futures Traders	Dear Futures Trader, What follows is the second issue of FutureSource's newest service, "FAST BREAK." Each weekly issue contains a discussion of the markets between two well known analysts and contributors to FutureSource, Jim Wyckoff and Dave Hightower. David Hightower is editor of the "Hightower Report", available on FutureSource Professional and ProNet. Call 800-621-2628 for more information, or click below: http://pronet.futuresource.com. Jim Wyckoff is a regular contributor to FutureSource.com. You are receiving this because you are a customer of Futuresource. HOWEVER, if you are no longer interested in the markets, and don't want to receive this free service, we respect that! Just scroll to the end, and click on the link. You will removed from the "FAST BREAK" list immediately. ________________________________________________________________ F U T U R E S O U R C E ' S F A S T B R E A K Volume I December 28, 2001 Issue #2 ________________________________________________________________ The past couple weeks have witnessed higher volatility in the currency markets, in the wake of a political and economic meltdown in Argentina, and as two nuclear-armed nations (India and Pakistan) step up their war rhetoric. Let's get the opinions of two seasoned and respected market analysts: David Hightower, editor of the Hightower Report (http://www.futures-research.com) and Jim Wyckoff, proprietor of "Jim Wyckoff on the Markets." FUTURESOURCE.COM: Dave, give us a basic fundamental perspective on the U.S. dollar and its major counterparts. HIGHTOWER: The U.S. dollar appears to have an entrenched bullish sentiment over the Euro and we would expect interest in the dollar to increase into the kick-off of the physical Euro currency implementation. However, it would seem that the dollar was quickly shut off from further buying this past week when it reached above 118. This is **************MESSAGE FROM A "FAST BREAK" SPONSOR*************** Optimize your short-term trading results with tips from the hot new trading manual, "Trader's Guide to Day-Trading."

It will be snail-mailed to you ASAP. http://www.futuresource.com/ads/manfinancial.htm **************************************************************** the second time that the dollar has been quickly repelled from that level. We have been suggesting for weeks that the US dollar is holding an extreme premium versus most of the world's currencies. Therefore, a leveling out of economic conditions would seem to pressure the dollar. We also think that the U.S. dollar has seen an unsustainable windfall off of Japanese yen weakness. Therefore, it is possible that the dollar will see a blow-off top in the coming week and that a major top could be formed. Historically, it would seem that several major turns in the currency markets have come in close proximity to the beginning of a new year. In the event that the dollar does turn down, we have to think that the Canadian and the Swiss will see the most significant recovery capacity. FUTURESOURCE.COM: Jim, give us more of a technical view on the U.S. dollar index and the major IMM currency futures. WYCKOFF: The past two weeks have seen the March U.S. dollar index spring sharply higher, after prices had been trending lower during late November and the first have of December. Last week, the March dollar index hit a high of 118.85, and has since seen some healthy consolidation of the recent strong gains. The dollar index bulls indeed have the near term edge, and the longer-term charts are also friendlier to the bulls. If the bulls can push the March dollar index above the 119.00 level, **************MESSAGE FROM A "FAST BREAK" SPONSOR*************** Today's trading tools for New Millennium trading success.

A drop below 114.75 means the market will likely languish in more of a choppy and sideways trading range in the near term. Bulls should be warned that if prices do sell off from here, a big head-and-shoulders top reversal pattern could develop on the weekly continuation chart for nearby dollar index futures. But right now, the bulls are enjoying the technical advantage. As for the Euro currency, the weekly continuation chart for nearby Euro futures should give the bulls some encouragement, as well as throw a scare into U.S. dollar index bulls. A longer- term downtrend line drawn off the 1998 high was penetrated on the upside and negated just about a year ago. Since that time, prices have been trading sideways in a choppy pattern. This choppy trading has also formed a coiling pattern--whereby the sideways trading range has become more compacted the past several weeks. This is suggestive of a bigger "breakout-type" price move in the not-too-distant future. Given the recent lowly price levels in the Euro, odds do favor that potential breakout being to the upside. There is also potential for a big double-bottom reversal pattern on the weekly chart. Indeed, there are clues on this chart that suggest the Euro currency bulls will enjoy more success in the coming year than they did in the past year. From a shorter-term perspective, if March Euro currency futures prices drop down below the November low of .8708, then the door is opened to much more downside. If that low can hold and prices work higher, then a big double-bottom reversal could be in the works. Finally, the Japanese yen has been in a nosedive for nearly two months. This steep decline appears to be a "washout" or exhaustion-type selling phase that many times precedes a major change in trend. But bottom-pickers should beware. Right now, would-be long-side traders do not want to stand in front of a steaming locomotive. They should first let the market show them some solid signals of strength before attempting to board the bullish train. FUTURESOURCE.COM: Thanks for the comments, Dave and Jim. We'll look forward to more of your insight in the coming weeks. ---------------------------------------------------------------- DISCLAIMER: Futures and Options trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk.

Update on Retention & Severance Plan	We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status. As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22. We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month. We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave. We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed. We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed. The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns. The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan. Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy. These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate. The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process. To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee. We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible. This is currently our top priority, bar none! When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be. Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place. We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation. The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved. That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse. We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan. We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court. We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court. With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future. In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week. And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.	0
RE: Vacation Policy Procedures	EA Estate Group: It is important for us, as a group to track and manage our vacation use appropriately based on business needs. If you would like to take vacation, please ensure that you receive approval from your supervisor in advance. Additionally, let your designated time keeper know what days you plan to be out of the office (time keepers are listed below). The timekeepers will be keeping a calendar of vacation days and will be updating it in the SAP system. If you have taken any vacation in 2002, please inform your designated timekeeper so this can be updated. TIMEKEEPER DEPARTMENT Angie Collins/Dina Snow Asset Marketing, QF/Structured Deals and Mexico Groups Cristina Zavala San Francisco Based Employees Daniel Quezada Gas Group Kathryn Sheppard Portland Based Employees Loretta Brooks E&P Mariner Group Lorie Leigh East Development and Technical Services Groups Tina Holcombe Power Group (Houston Based Employees) Kathryn Gonzales EES Trading/Auction Group If you have any questions regarding the vacation policy please contact Khymberly Booth at X52532, otherwise address your questions to your supervisor. Thank you, Don Miller	0
Vacation Policy Information	EA Estate Group: Please see the below reference of Enron's vacation eligibility, allowance, and scheduling policy: Vacation Eligibility: All regular full-time employees are eligible for vacation based on continuous service. Regular part-time employees receive 40 hours per year of paid vacation per year. Temporary employees are not eligible for vacation. Vacation Allowance: Vacation allowance is based on an employee's continuous service according to the following schedule. Employees must be on the payroll and actively at work as of the first business day of the calendar month to accrue vacation for that month. If the first day of the month falls on a holiday or weekend, causing the employee to have a hire date other than the first, the vacation accrual date will be dated the first of the month so that the employee will accrue vacation for the month. (For example, an employee with a hire date of January 5, 1998 will have a vacation accrual date of January 1, 1998. The intent of this change is only to affect the vacation accrual date as explained; it is not to affect any other term, condition, privilege, or benefit of employment.) Length of Continuous Service--Vacation Allowed From hire date to the end of the calendar year in which the employee was hired -- Prorated accrual of 10 hours per month for each full calendar month completed. For an employee hired in a prior calendar year who has less than 10 years of service -- 3 weeks (120 hours) per year For an employee with at least 10 but less than 20 years of service -- 4 weeks (160 hours) per year For an employee with at least 20 years of service -- 5 weeks (200 hours) per year Vacation may be taken any time in the calendar year in which the employee will complete required service for 3 weeks, 4 weeks, or 5 weeks of vacation, per the schedule above, except for the hire year. Vacation Scheduling and Approval: Supervisors- The supervisor will develop a vacation schedule that ensures all essential operations are maintained effectively. All vacation requests are subject to Supervisor approval. Tthe Estate will continue to implement its current policy with respect to the payment of unused vacation under most circumstances. Any questions regarding this policy should be addressed to Khymberly Booth @ X52532. Thanks- ENA Human Resources	0

Enron Legal Edge Signon Changes	Dear Legal Edge User, If you are using the Legal Edge portal, please read this very important message. We wanted to inform you that changes have been made to access the Enron Legal Edge portal. What to Expect When accessing the legal edge portal at http://legaledge.corp.enron.com/tibco/, you will be prompted for a user name and password as usual. However, the user name has changed. You will no longer log into the portal with your legal edge passwords. Your access will be controlled via the standard Enron network directory. Therefore, effective immediately, you will login using the same user name and password used to login to your local workstation, your CORP ID. In addition to the different user name and password, there will be another change. Due to the application upgrade, any personalization you have made to the portal in the past will be lost. As those changes made are associated with your old legal edge portal user name, these personalizations will not automatically be applied to your CORP login. Therefore, do not be alarmed if you do not see all of the content you saw before. Simply, re-configure the portal for your CORP id to see the same content you saw before. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this issue. Benefits - Only one user name password to remember (Use CORP network id and password) - Not prompted for login for other applications participating in Single Signon - Once you login once, you will never be required to login again from that workstation (unless you click the logout link) Effective Date The Legal Edge portal / Single Signon integration is effective Friday, November 9. Forward Email to Administrative Staff Please forward this email to your the administrative staff of your department, so they can access the portal site. Thank you. Contact Us If you would like to provide feedback for the Single Sign-On effort, send an email to sso@enron.com. If you have issues or concerns regarding this change, please contact the Resolution Center at ext. 3-1411. Regards, The Legal Edge and Single Signon Teams sso@enron.com	2

SoCalGas Unbundling	The CPUC published the SoCalGas unbundling order yesterday however due to Outlook problems I was unable to distribute it until today. Attached is a direct link to the order for your review. Since I'm using the website link to Outlook to send this e-mail, please let me know if you can't open the attachment and I will send it again when Outlook is back up in Omaha. The order is about 163 pages in length so if you don't have a good copier and want a hardcopy please give either myself or Blair a call and we will provide it for you. Significantly for Transwestern is the section on Intrastate Transmission Capacity and the Open Season process. This can be found on pages 41-58 with the Open Season discussion on pages 44 and 45. On pages 126 and 140, the commission directs SoCal to include an additional 375mm/d of backbone (including receipt point) capacity in the open season process. This is important because it includes the 50mm/d at Needles (per SoCal's exhibits in the system adequacy docket). In the Comprehensive Settlement, Appendix B, North Needles is listed as having capacity of 750mm/d of Primary Access Rights from Transwestern. It would be my recommendation that we need to encourage SoCal to revise this Appendix B as directed by the Commission to include the 50mm/d as capacity with Primary Access Rights from Transwestern as they had previously indicated in the Systems Adequacy Proceeding. SoCalGas was directed to file an Advice Letter to establish tariff revision to implement this order within 15 business days of the effective date (December 11,2001). Assuming two holidays for Christmas and New Years Day, this would make their filing date January 3, 2002. If we all agree that we need to encourage SoCal to add the 50mm/d as part of the open season process, then this needs to be done prior to their Jan. 3rd filing. Steve/Lorraine, please let me know if I can be of assistance. Following their filing, interested parties have 20 days to file a protest and/or comments on an Advice Letter filing (January 23, 2002). Please review the order or pertinent portions and advise of any comments you may have for our response. I'll be in the office this week and on vacation between Christmas and New Years Day however I can be reached at home anytime. My home number is (402) 330-3860. gh	0

This filing to change Rule 30 in their tariff will document the changes effectuated by SoCalGas on Nov. 1 as it relates to the elimination of Windowing. Given our record and testimony in the GIR proceeding and the Systems Adequacy proceeding I hadn't intended to comment on this Advice Letter however I wanted to make sure you agreed with that position. Let me know what you think. Thanks. Glen -----Original Message----- From: "Dan Douglass" <douglass@energyattorney.com>@ENRON Sent: Friday, November 09, 2001 5:02 PM To: Hass, Glen; Harris, Steven Cc: Gregg Klatt Subject: SCG Advice 2837-A Glen and Steve: The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by AL2837. The purpose of this filing is to describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003. During the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method used to allocate receipt point capacity. SoCalGas agreed to make such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding windowing information to its tariffs. To comply with this directive, on August 6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission. Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point. SoCalGas is making these internal operating changes effective November 1, 2001. SoCalGas held meetings with upstream pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on October 18, regarding the upcoming changes. They were invited to ask any questions in the days leading up to the meetings. Comments and/or protests are due on November 21. Have a good weekend! Dan	0

VERY IMPORTANT ENRONONLINE STACK MANAGER CHANGES	We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes 1. Changes to Stack Manager: 1.1 Changes to toolbar icons: To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function: 1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets. To activate this feature: 1. Select a product and click on Product Properties 2. Check the Enable box 3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values 4. Click Update Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above $40.00 or below $30.00 You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered. Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute. 2. Changes to EnronOnline Website (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01) The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website: 2.1 Today's Transactions Float Window: In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

RE: Secondary firm delivery	Kevin, I need to follow up with Stacy Dickson on any possible revisions to the GTC. Also, it has been mentioned to me that the long description that appears on the website should include specific details as to when and how the buyer needs to notify Enron of the delivery point, alternate delivery point, or where they plan to park/store the gas. I'll get with you on Tuesday after I talk with Stacy about this. CW 3-7533 A US gas transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a Secondary Firm basis. The Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination Date. The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date to the Termination Date. The Effective Date is 01 May 2001. The Termination Date is 31 May 2001. The Transaction is for delivery at an ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect. The Purchaser will determine at what ML7 interconnect to take delivery. The volumes Delivered by the Seller are subject to reductions due to operational constraints on the ANR Pipeline system. In the event that scheduled volumes are reduced due to pipeline operational constraints, Buyer will designate an alternate ML7 delivery location until an unconstrained point is designated. In the event that the Buyer cannot take receipt at an alternative ML7 point, the Buyer must arrange for the gas to be delivered off-system, stored or parked at the Buyer's expense. These reductions due to Pipeline System constraints are not considered a failure to perform by the Purchaser. The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency. The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day	0
Internet E-mail	In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine. We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.	0

Natural Gas Origination	Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers. In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes: Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta. This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S. The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively. Strategic Asset Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions. This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization. This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads. Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

ACTION REQUESTED- Virus Scan Update	Everyone, Once again, there are a number of new viruses that have been released on the internet that are causing us to do frequent updates to our virus protection software. We have an automated process to update our workstations with the latest virus protection updates. However, there may be some machines that didn't get the update. In order to prevent these viruses from infecting your machine, please assist by doing one of the following tasks. 1. Logout of the network and log back in or 2. Click on START>PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition and then click the Live Update button. This will pop up a screen where you will have to click the "Next" button and then a "Finish" button. (If you are an EES user, you will only be able to use option #1 as you use a different virus protection product.) The proper version of the update pattern you need is: (9/24/2001, version 30924p) If you have questions or concerns, please direct them to your Resolution Center. Enron Global Technology	0
Computer Virus	There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet. The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like "Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment. The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment. At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment. However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems. If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively. If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message. It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.	2

Enron Center South Technology Watch	Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures. NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover. Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk. Turret Users An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication". Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors. While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels. The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment. Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret. The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret. To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below: Channel Avaya Stentophon Weather Channel 12401 801 CNN Headlines News 12402 802 CNN Financial News 12403 803 CNBC 12404 804 MSNBC 12405 805 Bloomberg 12406 806 Financial News Network 12407 807 CNN 12408 808 Fox Sports 12409 809 ESPN1 12410 810 Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all. We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move. Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers. Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing. Updates will be provided as they become available. Keeping an Open forum We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com	2

EPMI/EES draft ICAP paper	Attached is the second draft of Enron's comments to FERC on ICAP. The structure of the paper is summarised below: 1. RTO's are a positive step forward for the industry. 2. Spot markets are a necessary part of RTO development to ensure that the RTO can manage real time realiability. 3. A well functioning spot market eliminates the need for separate capacity type products such as ICAP, reserve margin (i.e. it achieves the objectives of iCap). The paper incorporates theoretical and emperical evidence from other sectors of the economy and deregulation in other parts of the world to support this conclusion. 4. During the transition from a regulated environment to RTO's there may be a 'political' need for ICAP. Specifically states that any interim proposal should be limited to 2 years after RTO implementation. 5. If that is the case, the paper sets out the two common theoretical platforms which can be used as a basis for ICAP. 6. Proposes two options based on the theroetical platforms. We would appreciate input on two issues. Firstly, Enron needs to make a decision on whether to limit our position to reliance on spot markets (i.e. don't suggest an interim solution). While this is attractive, it is unlikely that Enron will get support from other participants (ICAP payments subsidize generation investment so no support from IPP's and consumers are not as confident as Enron that competitive markets will maintain reliability so they will want to sustain ICAP). Secondly, drafting comments on the paper generally. Please note that the final section, that proposes the Enron solution, requires substantial redrafting which will be done if the consensus is to propose such a solution. A final draft will be sent out on the morning of Tuesday 10/16, the paper will be filed Wednesday.	0

Upcoming EEI Contract Activities	To All: The following was decided at the conference call on October 3: (1) The participants asked that the organization plan reflect that the Drafting Committee performs the executive function and heavy lifting for the EEI Contract Working Group. The Drafting Committee will be redesignated the Executive Committee and the Working Group called the Membership Group. New members of the Drafting Committee will be appointed by the Co-Chairs and ratified by the Membership Group. I've attached a revised organizational plan to reflect these and other points raised during the conference call. (2) The Drafting Committee should meeting sometime during the first two weeks of November. Both AEP and Jones Day have offered to host the meeting in Columbus, Ohio. The dates under consideration are 11/6,11/7, 11/8, 11/13, 11/14, or 11/15. The Drafting Committee would give final approval for the optional provisions and collateral annex before they are posted on the EEI website. In addition, the Drafting Committee would discuss the future organization of the contract group and a proposal for non-EEI members to contribute membership fees. (3) Subject to any objection by those not on the call, Noel Trask of the Exelon Power Team will be permitted to join the Drafting Committee. Finally for those who do not know yet, I will be taking a position with Constellation Power Source effective November 5. At this time it is not clear who will be the EEI point of contact for the Master Contract group. EEI, however, is committed to continued sponsorship of the agreement and related activities. It is unclear what role I will have with the group's activities as a Constellation employee. I've thoroughly enjoyed working with you over the past three years and hope to stay in contact with all of you. Regards,	1
Master Netting Agreement	All, attached is a redline of Master Netting Agreement against the previous Cook c draft and the proposed Collateral Annex. Please review and provide your comments to me by first thing Tuesday morning. Major issues for resolution: 1. We have determined that we should file on cash collateral in Canada. Peter Keohane is reviewing the forms and processes for such, including how to determine and establish priority with respect to same. Peter will coordinate with Credit concerning the mechanics of accomplishing the filings. 2. Due to the continued concern by some counsel in respect of mutuality issues for setoff and netted settlement (another form of setoff) "aggregate liability clauses" set forth in 3a and 3b have been included for our consideration. We must come to a consensus as to whether this language/concept should/must be included. If the answer is yes, is the language included the best tactic? 3. Mary Perkins is reviewing LC matters with banks to be sure the modified format set forth in this draft is satisfactory. Timing Objective: Our objective is to provide everyone another draft on Tuesday and finalize on Wednesday. This will require a conference call sometime Monday afternoon. Carol, Rick, David, Peter and Elizabeth please provide Esmeralda Gonzalez, my assistant, at 713 345-7621 with your Monday afternoon availability and she will set a time and advise you. For those of you who had a prior draft of the Collateral Annex, I could not get this redlined for some reason, I apologize. Carol, since I am out Friday will you please call Cadwalader and be sure they received this. Further, will you ask them to review the NY choice of law provision in light of Canada cash collateral issue. Thank you. David and Rick, in your review please give special attention to the calculation mechanisms utilized for the determination of the Collateral Requirement. Esmeralda, after you have determined availability, please send email to Carol, Elizabeth, Rick Antonoff, David Mitchell and Peter Keohane advising of the time (Houston time).

Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?	Wednesday February 6, 1:41 pm Eastern Time BusinessWeek Online DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders? Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?'']. Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business. Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg. For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron. ``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli. That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron?

APS Transmission prepetition payment	The particulars of the transaction: We are obligated to deliver 25 MW of power to WALC at Pinnacle Peak through 12/31/04. The company receives $45 for each MW delivered to WALC. Pinnacle Peak is not a liquid trading hub. There are only two utilities with facilities at Pinnacle Peak, WALC and APS. We are currently utilizing APS transmission to deliver energy to WALC during off peak hours. The cost of the APS transmission is $1.95. The energy to satisfy this obligation is available at Four Corners under contract from El Paso Electric. The energy from El Paso is contracted to be purchased through the end of this year under a prepetition agreement at a fixed price of $22.25. The Transmission Service Agreement will be terminated by APS for nonpayment of a prepetition obligation of $43,708.60. APS is the sole party able to provide transmission to Pinnacle Peak at this time. Absent the ability to purchase transmission from APS, the company will be forced to settle the WALC obligation at above market prices due to the illiquidity at Pinnacle Peak. These costs could run as high as $5. The inablity to purchase APS transmission for $1.95 will increase the company's costs by as much as $3 over the term of the WALC obligation. There are approximately 95,000 MWh remaining to be delivered to WALC for the remainder of 2001 on light load hours. The increased cost to deliver would result in an additional expense of $285,000 for the remaining deliveries this year. The increased cost for the entire term of the WALC agreement could exceed $1,000,000.	0

Supported Internet Email Addresses	Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already. Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses. To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com. IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center. We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com. Thank you for participation, cooperation and support. Enron Messaging Administration	2

Brazil Update	CUIABA Furnas: Nothing particularly new to report since last week, other than it appears we are likely to get the consent documents signed Tuesday or Wednesday. These documents reflect a resolution to the consent issue and the Resolution 49 regulatory issues that changed some of the risks under the PPA. As reported last week, one of the reasons Furnas/Electrobras have agreed to sign is because the two difficult issues regarding (i) the validity of the Electrobras guaranty following privatization; and (ii) political force majeure allowing a "put" option for Brazilian governmental acts, were deleted from the Furnas consent documents and will be negotiated separately with the Brazilian government over the next two weeks. These issues must also be resolved for financing. GT11/12: Repairs still on schedule to meet requirements under the PPA for the changeover to gas by year end. Siemens and our engineers will meet with the underwriters in London tomorrow to discuss the root cause of the failures. Still no written confirmation of coverage, but we currently do not anticipate a problem. Shell: Preparing for mediation to be held in Toronto November 5-7. ANNEX V After reporting last week that the cost pass through suits had been filed, I learned that Orlando Gonzales made the commercial decision to hold off on those suits because of significant progress he made in negotiations with the Brazilian government for resolution of these issues and Annex V. Elektro received some of the information from ASMAE for calculating its numbers; however, as of Friday it had not received the information for the rationing period, the relevant period for calculating the set off. I talked with Vasco this morning and he believed this information was received today and will confirm. If the information is not forthcoming, we are prepared to file a suit to compel it. I will stay in touch with Orlando this week to determine if and when we can file these suits without interfering with his negotiations. Regards, Michelle	0

Proposed Housekeeping Solution	Following up on the earlier email I sent, it may make sense to delegate a lot of the information gather than we will need for conflicts/disclosure requirements (in the event of contingency planning) to Lisa Mellencamp.

If you think that makes sense, let me know -- or better yet, you can ask Lisa to call Sylvia Baker at 713-546-5087, who has been charged with the responsibility of getting this information together and into our system.

Confirmation Process	We will be implementing an additional confirm process going forward. All broker deals will be booked by Risk and placed in TAGG to generate a confirmation. Before the confirmation is sent to the counterparty, the Enron trader will sign off on the confirm. All broker deals will be handled this way. Please generate a new daily summary report of all broker deals by trader in the west region. This will allow me to verify if the new process is being handled properly. Anne, please communicate this to your group.	0

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment. We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now. If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com. Thank you for your support.	2

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.

IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan	If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance.

Assistance for Enron Alumni	Dear Enron Alum: The Ford Career Center at the McCombs School of Business is very concerned about the welfare of our alumni who have been working with Enron. We wanted to make all of our Enron alumni aware of the services we are able to offer to assist them if they need or choose to do a job search at this time. Most of these services are available remotely through our web site at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu/ . * Free access to UT job postings at https://accessut.utexas.edu/students . This system requires a UTEID to log in. If you do not have one or cannot remember yours, there is a link on the login screen to request one. There are generally more than 1,000 jobs on this system at any time for a variety of skills sets and experience levels. We encourage you to take advantage of this. * Free access to the Vault Career Library. (Link listed in "also see" box on our web page at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu/mba/ .) With your UTEID you have access to thousands of company profiles and industry guides. * Free access to the materials in our on-site Career Library. We have hundreds of books, periodicals and on-line subscriptions to assist you with your job search. The Career Library is open 8-5, Monday-Friday. * Access to our recruiting database and participation in our alumni resume book for only $75. (Details and registration at http://cso.bus.utexas.edu/alum/ .)

We also actively market our on-line alumni resume book available through our recruiting database system and have given access to nearly 100 companies in the past few months. Participation is included in the $75 recruiter database access fee.

FW: Curve Validation	Phillip, Susan Scott needs to retrieve my e-mails from December and January for curve validation. Can you please pass this request onto Roberto DeLeon in IT Security.	0
Broker quotes required for validation - West	All, Attached is a spreadsheet of Enron's curve names for the West book. We just need a quick status on the broker quotes you have and the ones still needed/missing. Please review the curves against the broker data you have (including electronic files), and indicate any gaps. Based on your reply, the Estate will purchase the missing data. Please have this prepared by 12:00 tomorrow.	0
Location of Curve Validation Progress Tracking Summaries	I just wanted to clarify the purpose and file location of the "Progress Summaries". These speadsheets are located at O:\CurveValidation\Estate Reporting\Gas. There are a total of four tracking summaries, one for each region (East, West, Texas, Canada/Central). Please update these documents as you validate each of the natural gas curves. Thanks again for all of your help.	0
FW: 'Progress Summary' updates	Since the 'Progress Summary' worksheets are blank for all regions, I'm assuming that no curves have been validated for any dates at close-of-business today (2/18/02). The reason I'm confirming this is because I'm being asked for a daily status update. Please remember to update your respective 'Progress Summary' sheets daily prior to going home. They are located at O:\CurveValidation\Estate Reporting\Gas. Focus your validation on the first week of Dec. initially. Once that week is done, focus on the next week (and so on). Thanks for your efforts,	0
RE: 'Progress Summary' updates	Susan, Your progress notes were in the tracking sheet, I just didn't notice them last night. Sorry about that. If you plan on revising the curves in the 'Revised Price' column of the templates, don't bother updating the summary sheet until you've done that. Remember, if you do revise a portion of the curve, that revised piece needs to be copied and pasted into the next day's template in Column D. Essentially, the summary sheet should be filled in when a date's curve has either been validated or revised and is awaiting review by Ed. If you can complete all your basis curves by the end of the week so Ed can review and sign-off, that would be great. I hope this clears things up. Let me know if you have any questions,	0
Location of Curve Roll-off report	We would like to inform everyone that PwC has created a comprehensive position report with data obtained from the gas mid-office.The report checks gas curve positions each Friday from 11-30-01 to 2-1-02 (ten periods). It will tell you the first start date and the last end date of positions on each curve we are reviewing. Thanks again for all of your help.	0
RE: Location of Curve Roll-off report	Just to clarify...the report can be found at O:\CurveValidation\Estate Reporting\Gas\Position Roll-off report.	0
Curve mapping	Susan, I am busy this morning. Can we do this early this afternoon, say at 1:30? Also can you please send an email to my supervisor Chris Constantine and our main business user Bjorn Hagelmann to outline what the request is. Thanks,	0
Forward Curve Validation/Revision Progress Tracking	I noticed that a few of you had revised/validated several curves and that your work was not accurately reflected on the Progress Summary sheets. These sheets are an essential reporting tool for project management. Please update the progress sheets with your recent work or communicate your progress to Kathy Kelly so that she can perform the updates on your behalf if necessary. As a reminder, the sheets are located at O:\CurveValidation\Estate Reporting\Gas organized by region (Progress Summary - East, Progress Summary - Texas, etc.). Also, when you complete a template by either revising or validating the ERMS pricing data, please remember to place an "R" or "V" in the yellow box near the top of the template. Thanks for your help.	0

TAG 40700	Hey Guys - Well, I had to learn some Cod Scheduling fast this afternoon, (we really do need to exchange new cell phone numbers :-)). Anyway, tag #40700 was incorrect and BPA called about 3:45. I cancelled that tag and replaced it with tag #40716 I hope what I did was okay, let me know if I should have done it differently. On the NW sheet that tag number is highlighted in yellow in case there is a problem. I assume the something needs to be corrected in the preschedule workspace, but I don't know what it is, so I will leave it to Cara or Donald to explain it to me in the morning. Thanks again, Serena	0

Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?	Wednesday February 6, 1:41 pm Eastern Time BusinessWeek Online DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders? Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?'']. Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business. Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg. For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron. ``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli. That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron?

FERC meeting: SE RTO	Judge McCartney presented her report on the SE RTO mediation to FERC last Wed. Her recommendation was for the Grid model: Transco on top/Independent Market Admin. (IMA) in the RTO (model presented by GridSouth, Grid Florida and Entergy) rather than Southern's model (Gridco on top, transmission owners and ind. transcos under). The Commissioners did not make a decision, but stated that they planned to address the SE RTO at the next Commission meeting on Nov 7 (after they have received comments on RTO week). The judge discussed the biggest obstacles to public power agreeing to the Grid model: Southern gave them 100% transmission recovery on Day 1 and the Grids had a phase-in (pursuant to the Commission's previous orders in GridFlorida). I think that many of the publics also liked the fact that Southern gave them full grandfathering of current contracts. Chair Wood had questions about the split of responsibilities between the transmission-owning transco on top and the IMA and about the fiduciary duties of the transco board. The judge stated that most publics wanted a non-profit ISO on top. When Massey stated that most states wanted the traditional non-profit ISO, Wood said: "that would put the cabosh on this model," then asked why the publics don't like the operating agreements with the RTO. There was discussion about concerns that the transco would favor transmission solutions over gen. Massey pointed out that the NE ISOs simply don't want their models changed, so that should not keep the Commission from approving the transco-type model. Breathitt stated that cost/benefit analyses were important, especially for this region of low cost power. Brownell stated that the Commission needed to act quickly because the market was already putting capital into transcos.	0
RE: Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy	With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that: Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts. Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal. Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement. We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it. Best, Jeff	0
SEC Inquiry	As you know, the SEC is conducting an informal inquiry into related party transactions Enron did with LJM. We are cooperating fully and are providing the information the SEC has requested. However, we have learned today that the SEC is extremely sensitive about us using their inquiry as a "shield" to not answer certain questions -- i.e. "I can't answer that because of a pending SEC inquiry." As a result, we have been advised that we should not make any comment about the SEC inquiry in any context. This extends beyond media and includes any interactions with customers, regulators, etc. Please forward this message on to anyone in your group who this might impact. Call me if you have any questions. Thank you. Karen	0
Paul Hennemeyer	Rick -- here is the offer letter for Paul. I believe it has everything noted except if we are going to allow for a house hunting trip prior to his moving. I'm told this is usually done in conjunction with a business trip, so I'm not sure if that could be worked in for Paul. In addition, to get any questions answered he may have about the benefits in Mexico, I would suggest that he call Melizza Evanson, the HR Rep that is the liaison for our employees in Mexico. She works very closely with the HR/Payroll people in Mexico and is the most knowledgeable. Tim Callahan did say that the Benefits in the UK are greater than they are even in the US, and the benefits in the US are even greater than those in Mexico. However, he didn't elaborate on the specifics of any particular benefits. Melizza did say that the cost of living in Mexico is extremely low, so the employees there are provided with a driver, maids, etc. Anyway, take a look at the letter and let me know if you need any revisions. And please have Paul call Melizza directly at (713) 345-7855 with any questions. Thanks. Jo Ann	0

Greeley Gas Oct 01	Hi Theresa, I just got through redrafting for October to pull in the new storage volumes and prices. It looks like there are three new demand charges.

OBA Imbalance Sheet	Scott & Walt: A couple of things...I talked to Theresa today and the OBA Spreadsheet (or actually, Enron's imbalance sheet) needs to be changed for both October and November as follows: October: ENA purchased 300 mmbtu/d from Westport at the Bear Paw point beginning October 9. We need to add a column on the ENA sheet (i.e. similar to Phillips) showing that 300 mmbtu. Quantum - ENA did not purchase any gas from Quantum for October. We had some measurement of gas from Quantum throughout the month. This needs to go to imbalance between Quantum and Crestone. November: ENA is purchasing 1,000 mmbtu/d from Quantum. If Quantum produces more than 1,000 mmbtu/d that extra goes to imbalance between Quantum and Crestone. ENA is not purchasing Westport's gas at this time. I would be happy to make these changes, but I am unsure as to how this file affects your Meter Allocation report and I don't want to mess that one up!!! I'm copying Theresa on this memo....please feel free to add to it if I missed something.	0
RE: Crestone Imbalance	There is an interconnect between WIC and FUGG for 09/01. The WIC # ties to the statement. Can you please check the FUGG # ? Right now, I have some extra time. I would love to help you guys with this imbalance. Could I take a look at 08/01? Please let me know. Thanks, Gloria	0
Wyoming Interstate Gas Company (WIC) Maintenance	On Tuesday, November 13, 2001, the Douglas Station will be out of service for approximately 8 hours.

Pipeline Dial Up access	Please ask your schedulers to e-mail me which pipelines still maintain the ability to do Nominations via a dial up connection to their EBB (modem and a phone line). Please ask them to call their representatives if unsure.	0
RE: Crestone Imbalance	I adjusted for the rounding, and then deliveries were off by 2,000; 1,000 on the 26th and 1,000 on the 27th. So I made that adjustment to ENA on contract #96026750. Now the ENA volumes tie to the WIC contract #52700000, so no interconnect problem now.	0

NE HRLY DEALS 10/15 THRU 10/19	Paul, Attached is a spreadsheet with the deals for HRLY NE for 10-15 thru 10-19. It appears that most of the deals are financial deals done at R1E (Westhub), R1C (NY West), and R1B (Nepool). These deals all have financial true-ups that come through in the financial liquidations line on your P&L. I have tried to break the liquidations values down deal by deal. When looking at the deals, please note that the liquidation amounts are the opposite value that they appear on the spreadsheet. For instance, looking in the highlighted yellow column, the value should be the opposite value shown. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks	0

NYISO-related filings	Two items of note with regard to NYISO: - On November 5, 2001, PSEG Energy Resources & Trade filed a complaint against the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO), requesting that the Commission restore the original market clearing prices for energy for May 9, 2000. PSEG claims that NYISO violated its tariff and Commission orders approving Temporary Extraordinary Procedure (TEP) authority by 1) identifying a purported market flaw associated with bids submitted by an Energy Limited Resource and 2) remedying the market flaw by re-pricing certain hourly clearing prices in a manner inconsistent with its tariff on May 8 & 9, 2000. PSEG was a seller in the real time market on May 9, 2000 and lost revenues as a result of NYISO's Extraordinary Corrective Action. Interventions and protests are due by November 26, 2001. (EL02-16-000) - On November 16, 2001, NYISO filed a request for a stay of the Commission's decision to require the NYISO to re-bill for operating reserves for March 2000, pending the NYISO's appeal of that decision. In March 2000, NYISO made an "exigent circumstances" filing seeking the imposition of various bidding restrictions to prevent alleged market power abuses. The Commission's order only partially granted NYISO's request, and did not allow NYISO to re-calculate March 2000 operating reserves prices. The Commission has not yet issued any notice of the filing. If you need further information please contact me.	0

Summary of Entitlements - Revised (Disregard Previous E-mail)	Jay, this spreadsheet has a summary of the exit and operational entitlements that TETCO has provided Enron that Yankee granted. Assuming that you do not wish to modify the two smaller release offers (#19996 and #19997), I have provided you exactly what needs to be done to modify the larger release offer (#19998). It is important that the releases grant us the minimal exit entitlements by production zone to M1 as well as M1 to M3 /M1 to M2 as noted in "Exhibit A". I will be working in NY on Monday. However, Judy Townsend and Ruth Concannon are familiar with this deal structure. Judy is most familiar with the current issues. I will be visiting with Ruth early on Monday. In the meantime, Judy can answer any questions. Judy tends to be busy trading until 11:00 AM CST. She may not be able to spend as much time with you in the morning. However, Ruth will be able to assist if Judy is busy. I will give you a call from the road around 9:00 AM. We will get this done together...Thanks!!!	0

-	Hi All-- Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERC's order in the Transco 1Line / Order 637 proceeding and in the Texas Gas cash-out proceeding. Transco is saying they won't implement "prior to April 1" but haven't decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet. .The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement. Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order, so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized. Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order (almost $80m), it's likely that the dollars will be subject to the on-going negotiations taking place in Transco's RP01-245 rate case proceeding. I'll coordinate with Tammy to insure that we've got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes. On Texas Gas, this represents a minor win for us--we had argued that Texas Gas' proposal was not consistent with Order 637 and that they should adopt a more "Transco-like" scheme that creates uncertainty w/o creating undue penalties. Texas Gas will have to refile & we'll have another go-round between the marketing companies/producers and the LDC's on the Texas Gas system. Will keep you posted. Please let me know if you have any questions.	0

New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals	This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals. The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done. These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative. Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny. FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates. During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was "important to keep in mind, as we rush into the brave new world on the gas side," that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory basis by pipelines." Last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory trend," he asserted. In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment. FERC declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an "appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers. In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally available tariffs. The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a negotiated-rate package, "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order. Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an "adequate alternative," the commission observed. "However, if the customer desires a special contract demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not include any such provision." A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain degree of risk, giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers," the commission pointed out. "A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges," FERC said, adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner." Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will be negotiated" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language "will require the pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers." Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in the arm for a program that had become "muddled." Through a "tortured line of cases," FERC's definitions of allowable contracting practices were "obscured," Breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense" approach. The "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers, she said.	0
PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN	Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan. The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29: ? Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock. The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan. ? After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions. As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan. ? The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options. Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts. This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account. These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts. To move funds: On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu. On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts." This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC. To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.	2

Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017). Thank you for your help in this matter.	2

RE: City of Santa Clara	Kim - You should probably hold off on the financial trading for now. Santa Clara is a municipal entity, and until Legal has scrubbed them for authorization to trade financially, we can't do anything with them. As you know, this is not a quick endeavor. I can start working on a Master Physical right away, though. Do you have updated financial info from them?	0

NCPA Gas Restructuring	Kim, Stewart and I met with Tom Lee (tomlee@ncpa.com; 916.761.4220) of NCPA yesterday. NCPA is looking to restructure a power deal with Calpine and a gas basis deal with Pan Canadian. The following summarizes the gas transaction and the re-structuring as proposed by Tom. Current Gas Structure Term: January 1, 2002 - December 31, 2002 Quantity: 5,000 MMBtu/d Delivery Pt.: PG&E City-Gate Price: NYMEX + $3.37/MMBtu Re-Structuring Option 1 Extend the term through 2004. What is the blended basis? Re-Structuring Option 2 (Kim, please note that the following structure is Tom Lee's creation). ENA assumes NCPA's position for Q2 2002 only (April-June): 5,000 MMBtu/d @ PG&E City-Gate @ NYMEX + $3.37/MMBtu. ENA buys 3 puts from NCPA involving 5,000 MMBtu/d @ PG&E City-Gate over a 3 year term ending 2004: a) Exercisable on Dec 15, 2001, ENA has the option to put 5,000 MMBtu/d to NCPA in Q1, Q3 and/or Q4 of 2002. b) Exercisable on Dec 15, 2002, ENA has the option to put 5,000 MMBtu/d to NCPA in Q1, Q2, Q3 and/or Q4 of 2003. c) Exercisable on Dec 15, 2003, ENA has the option to put 5,000 MMBtu/d to NCPA in Q1, Q2, Q3 and/or Q4 of 2004. What is the strike price? Re-Structuring Option 3 (Kim, this is my idea. That is, I think this makes more sense than Tom's). ENA assumes NCPA's position for Q2 2002 only (April-June): 5,000 MMBtu/d @ PG&E City-Gate @ NYMEX + $3.37/MMBtu. ENA sells NCPA 5,000 MMBtu/d of gas at PG&E City-gate for calendar years 2002 through 2004 except for Q2 2002. Given that we are absorbing the $3.37/MMBtu basis for Q2 2002, what is the all-in fixed price for this sale? Tom is looking for an answer ASAP. Is the above confusing enough? Call me if we need to talk about this. Laird	0

Palo Alto Invoice--Aug 01.xls	Kim- Here is the August spreadsheet. These are the changes I've made so far: I changed the formula in column R I added in the new contracts for August The differences between my model and the invoice are the way that they calculate the actual gas flow to Malin (column L on mine and column Z on theirs); It also appears that they do not include the Redwood credit. Looking at my model now, I also don't remember what the calculation in column D is for. It seems kind of unnecessary to me and doesn't make much sense. I know this is a lot of stuff to look at. If you don't understand what I just wrote, ask me and I'll explain what I'm trying to say. Thanks, Mara	0

Online Trading Simulation	We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8. To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from 0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading. Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will: Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.) Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions: Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.) Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation. Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation. Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation. After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete. Next steps Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system. Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6. UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation. Summary This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).	1

Ft. Pierce Evaluation	Jennifer, attached is a summary model of the Ft. Pierce evaluation using Enron's curves. Please note that there are two scenarios provided, based on a best case and worst case pipeline demand charge scenario. The spread option model was dispatched based on the same assumptions as utilized by the gas group in developing their pipeline cost assumptions. I've tried to add notes to the models outlining potential areas of additional value as there are some unique characteristics of this deal that should provide additional value to the project. I'll be over to help review the cash flow model. Thanks for everyone's help (Edith/Charlie)	0

Enron Center South Technology Watch	Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures. NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover. Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk. Turret Users An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication". Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors. While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels. The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment. Here's how: Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret. The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret. To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below: Channel Avaya Stentophon Weather Channel 12401 801 CNN Headlines News 12402 802 CNN Financial News 12403 803 CNBC 12404 804 MSNBC 12405 805 Bloomberg 12406 806 Financial News Network 12407 807 CNN 12408 808 Fox Sports 12409 809 ESPN1 12410 810 Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.

We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing. Updates will be provided as they become available.

RE: Var simulation	Andy, Here are some numbers. For the options, we have used your vols, for swaps our system vols. I was not able to work on the GD stuff because our system cannot get a VaR on those on-the-fly (though it does calculate it). We don't have access to UBS's models. We will be using our model. They use Historical Simulations which are not very appropriate for a lot of energy products. In 1 and 2, these were ATM straddles (average price in 2 was 2.30). 1) 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%. VaR = $745 2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48% VaR = $16,356 3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46% Will provide later 4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap VaR = $73,863 5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap VaR = $409,559 6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap VaR = $135000 7).

Planning for our Next Meeting in Detroit	Richard, Derrick and Alan: I think we can all agree that Thursday's conference call was very constructive and promising. In order to ensure that we work together in the most efficient and effective manner, let us make sure that our communication channels among the four groups (Enron Net Works, Enron Global Markets, GM IS&S and GM Worldwide Purchasing) is always inclusive. I suggest the following contacts on all correspondence: ENW - John Allario (713-853-4587) EGM - Alan Engberg (713-853-5279) IS&S - Mike Darrow (313-665-5206) WWP- Derrick Starosa (810-575-2221) EGM and ENW have begun putting together the product and market description for each of the products specified at today's conference call. John and Alan are coordinating that effort along with Enron's Fundamentals Group. My understanding is WWP will likewise be ready to discuss its operational and product issues during the upcoming meeting in Detroit, tentatively scheduled for the week of June 11th. The EGM/ ENW teams will provide a well researched product and market opinion of those petrochemicals initially deemed lacking sufficient market traction as well as those petrochemicals specified by WWP as potential Pilot Program participants. Those potential Pilot Petchems were identified as: (1) Benzene, (2) Butadiene, (3) Cumene, (4) Ethylene, (5) Methanol, (6) PG Propylene, (7) Styrene, (8)Toluene. Let's plan to determine the best day(s) to meet in Detroit by next Wednesday, June 6th. Please advise me of any questions you may have or of any errors or omissions, which this email may contain. I look forward to working together will all of you on this effort over the next two weeks. Best regards, -John	0

Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues	As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron. We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other. In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed. Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron. It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained. To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017). Thank you for your help in this matter.	2

Continue to call these customers regarding password applications, but do not promise that the ISDA documents, etc. are immediately forthcoming until we receive those worksheets from credit. Please continue to pass on both the pa information and the draft packets as you receive the correct contact info.

Terminated Counterparty Contracts	I attach an updated list (to Feb 5) of the terminated contracts to date. F= or informational purposes, I have added a column that sets out the settleme= nt dates for contracts we have settled, so there may be some additional cou= nterparties added to my previous list where there was no ECC agreed termina= tion date but we have settled and terminated (no one needs to do anything f= or these c/ps). Again, the first table sets forth the physical contracts t= hat have been terminated and the second sets out the financial contracts, a= nd all data reflects ECC's (not the counterparties') perception of the worl= d. I have vetted my list against Blakes' master list and believe this is a= ccurate in all respects. As I indicated in my previous e-mails to you ther= e were a few date discrepancies and I have previously provided you with the= corrected dates for El Paso, Marathon, AEC Marketing, Calpine (Encal), Wil= liams Energy and Baytex (all physical), all which are now correctly reflect= ed in the attachment. A few others that were not previously on the list in= clude Coast Energy (physical) which auto terminated on Dec 2 and PrimeWest = Energy (physical) which auto terminated on Dec 2. =20 Thanks Greg	0
Termination Dates	Further to prior e-mails, I have now confirmed with Blakes that the following c/ps originally had the wrong termination dates set. They have now been corrected to the appropriate dates, all of which were Feb 1, 2002 (John, these are the same ones I identified to you last week). AEC Marketing, physical, gas - February 1, 2002 Calpine Canada Natural Gas Partnership (Encal) physical, gas - February 1, 2002 El Paso Merchant Energy, physical gas - February 1, 2002 Williams Energy Marketing & Trade Co. - February 1, 2002	0
Updated List	I have updated the list to reflect all changes received. If you notice any more errors or if any counterparties have been reassigned, please let me know so that I can continue to make changes. Also, please see Louise's additions at the bottom of the list (from Adams Resources Marketing downward) and let me know if you have good relationships with any of these counterparties and could please take responsibility for them. Otherwise, our marketing team will be contacting these customers. Finally, please note that even though there may be names for a specific counterparty in both the gas and the power columns, the person ultimately responsible for contacting that customer regarding the password application and registration forms is the person in the PA column on the far right. Please remember when you are speaking to your customers to get all contact info possibly including contact name, phone and fax, e-mail, and address and send all this to Mary Griff Gray so that she can send them the PA and registration forms. Please call me at 5-3614 if you have any questions or come by my desk at 06541. Jennifer McQuade	0

Online Launch Plan Update	With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift: Week of Jan 28: We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain: Key Messages Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Top Counterparty Checklist External Customer Cover Letter Password Application (PA) Registration Form Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) Internal online Marketing Contact List Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site. A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users. The Splash page will look something like the following: Week of Feb. 4: We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. Week of Feb. 11: The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity. Trading/Origination Coordination The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.
